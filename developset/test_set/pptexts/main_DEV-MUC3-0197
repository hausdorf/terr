    TONIGHT, AT APPROXIMATELY 1940, A BOMB WENT OFF AT A U.S.
EMBASSY WAREHOUSE NEAR THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL COMPLEX ON SAN ANTONIO
ABAD STREET IN NORTHWEST SAN SALVADOR.  THE UP TO DATE NEWS TEAM, WHICH WAS
ON THE SCENE SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT, WAS SHOOTING VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THE
EXTENSIVE DAMAGE DONE BY THE BOMBS WHEN U.S. EMBASSY EMPLOYEES ATTACKED THE
CAMERAMAN AND HIS ASSISTANT. THE VIDEO EQUIPMENT WAS DAMAGED.  HERE IS WHAT
HAPPENED:

      

    WE DO NOT DESERVE TO BE MISTREATED LIKE THIS.  

    WE ARE NOT MISTREATING YOU.  GET OUT.  

    AT THIS POINT, THE CAMERA BELONGING TO THE UP TO DATE NEWS
TEAM WAS THROWN ON THE FLOOR.  SO FAR, NO GROUP HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE.  SHORTLY AFTER THE
