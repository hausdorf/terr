   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [INTERVIEW WITH DR
EDUARDO COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, BY NELSON
LOPEZ] [TEXT] [BEGIN RECORDING] [COLINDRES] THE PDC [CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY] CONDEMNS THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENCY MINISTER DR
ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.  IT BELIEVES VIOLENCE WILL NOT SOLVE THE
COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS, IS NOT THE WAY TO SETTLE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES,
AND WILL NOT LEAD TO PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT.

   WE HOPE THIS CONDEMNABLE ACT WILL NOT BE FOLLOWED BY AN ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE AND REVENGE THAT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO FURTHER POLARIZE SALVADORAN
SOCIETY.  THE PDC EXPRESSES ITS CONDOLENCES TO THE REPUBLIC'S GOVERNMENT,
THAT IS, THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, AND RODRIGUEZ' GRIEVING
FAMILY.  WE URGE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT, TO FIND A
POLITICAL AND PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS THAT IS CURRENTLY AFFLICTING
OUR SOCIETY.  THIS IS THE PDC'S POSITION ON THE CONDEMNABLE ASSASSINATION OF
DR ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

   [LOPEZ] DR COLINDRES, DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ESCALATION
OF VIOLENCE BY THE EXTREME RIGHT?

   [COLINDRES] WE HOPE REASON WILL PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS
OR ANY OTHER INCIDENT SHOULD NOT LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, BECAUSE
THAT WOULD ONLY RESULT IN MORE BLOODLETTING AMONG THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  I
BELIEVE WE MUST NOT FALL FOR THE TRAP OF VIOLENCE THAT WOULD ONLY DESTROY US.

   [LOPEZ] IT IS PRESUMED THAT THIS ACTION INVOLVED LEFTIST URBAN COMMANDOS
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT POLITICAL GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE?

   [COLINDRES] LET US WAIT AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE
BEEN THE FMLN OR ULTRARIGHTIST FACTIONS SEEKING FURTHER POLARIZATION AND
BLOODLETTING.  WE DO NOT WANT TO PASS JUDGMENT YET.  REGARDLESS OF WHO DID
IT, THIS IS AN ASSASSINATION, WHICH IS NOT THE PROPER WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
AMONG SALVADORANS.  

   [LOPEZ] IN THE PDC'S OPINION, WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES
IN THE WAKE OF DR RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ASSASSINATION?  

   [COLINDRES] I BELIEVE THE ARMED FORCES MUST CONTINUE THEIR POLICY OF
PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE THIS IMPLIES
RESPECTING THE LAW AND STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTION OF THE ARMED FORCES.
THEY HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND CALM OF THE
ENTIRE POPULATION.

   [LOPEZ] WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING?  

   [COLINDRES] ONLY THAT WE HOPE THIS KIND OF REGRETTABLE AND CONDEMNABLE
INCIDENT WILL NOT BE REPEATED.  WE ALSO HOPE THAT VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION
AMONG SALVADORAN BROTHERS WILL END ONCE AND FOR ALL. [END RECORDING]
