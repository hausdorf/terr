   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 23 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] STEPPING UP
SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA AND PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ' WARNING THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST
BE STRENGTHENED ARE VENEZUELA'S VISIBLE REACTIONS TO THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF
LIBERAL PARTY LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN.

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS LEARNED THAT EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, RECENTLY ARRESTED
IN COLOMBIA AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCES, WAS TRYING TO PURCHASE LAND IN VENEZUELA TO
EXPAND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION.

   ACCORDING TO PEREZ, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS COULD BE MOVED
TO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY.  THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT STRESSED THE NEED TO
ADOPT STRONG MEASURES AGAINST SUCH A POSSIBILITY.  "THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE
MUST UNITE IN THIS BATTLE," THE HEAD OF STATE SAID.  HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT
VENEZUELA WILL SUPPORT COLOMBIA BY STEPPING UP SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER.

   IN THIS SENSE, VENEZUELAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL FILMO LOPEZ UZCATEGUI
ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF "TASK FORCES" THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED ALONG
VENEZUELA'S WESTERN BORDER.  THESE TASK FORCES WILL CARRY OUT INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT THE MILITARY UNITS STATIONED IN THE AREA.

   THE MINISTER REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF PARAMILITARY PERSONNEL BEING
RECRUITED TO FORM THE "TASK FORCES" AND ADDED THAT INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONE
THAT OCCURRED IN EL AMPARO ON THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA LAST YEAR WHEN A
GROUP OF SOLDIERS MURDERED 17 FISHERMEN WILL NOT BE REPEATED.

   "WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY TO
CONTINUE THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, THE MINISTER SAID.

   ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY SOURCES STATIONED ALONG THE COLOMBIAN -
VENEZUELAN BORDER, AND CARRIED IN TODAY'S EDITION OF EL NACIONAL, MEDELLIN
CARTEL TREASURER MARTINEZ ROMERO WANTED TO BUY LAND IN ZULIA AND TACHIRA,
TWO VENEZUELAN STATES, TO EXPAND THE ORGANIZATION'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.

   ACCORDING TO ZULIA STATE GOVERNOR ISMAEL ORDAZ, THE SECURITY CORPS HAVE
BEEN ALERTED IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKING "CAPOS"
MAY HAVE FLED INTO VENEZUELA AS A RESULT OF THE PERSECUTION UNLEASHED IN
COLOMBIA FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN ON 18 AUGUST.
