   SAN SALVADOR, 3 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTRY FLATLY DENIED CHARGES RAISED YESTERDAY BY AN ALLEGED
"JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND" THAT BLAMES CERTAIN OFFICERS OF THE ARMED
FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CATEGORICALLY
REJECTED "ALL TYPES OF SLANDER AND CHARGES AGAINST ITS MEMBERS,"
REFERRING TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED DOCUMENT THAT IT SAID "LACKS ALL LOGIC
AND CREDIBILITY."

   THE OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT "IN THESE MOMENTS, THE
ARMED FORCES ARE UNITED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE DEFENSE OF THE
FATHERLAND," ADDING THAT THE DOCUMENT ANONYMOUSLY DISTRIBUTED
YESTERDAY TO THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS IS "GREY PROPAGANDA."

   IN THE FOUR-PAGE DOCUMENT, A SO-CALLED "JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND"
STATES THAT "COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, CHIEF OF THE TREASURY
POLICE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE (JESUITS') MURDERS."

   THE AUTHORS OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADD THAT THE "TROOPS FROM THAT
SECURITY CORPS LED BY CAPTAIN ALONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA" CARRIED OUT THE
EXECUTIONS," BUT IT DID NOT PROVIDE ANY DETAILS TO BACK UP THE
ACCUSATIONS.

   THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO MORE PERSONS WERE KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER,
SHOT DURING THE NIGHT BY A GROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES OF THE CRIME.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION, INVITING
FOREIGN EXPERTS TO PARTICIPATE.

   THE OFFICIAL DEFENSE MINISTRY NOTE WARNED THAT "THE FORCE THAT
MAINTAINS THIS SOLID UNITY (OF THE ARMED FORCES) IS THE BLOOD SHED BY
OUR SOLDIERS TO DEFEND THE FATHERLAND AND OUR IDEAS, CUSTOMS,
RELIGION, DEMOCRACY, AND FREEDOM."

   THE MINISTRY'S COMMUNIQUE URGES THE CITIZENS "NOT TO ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO BE DECEIVED BY THE AMOUNT OF RUMORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
PRESSURES THAT THE MARXIST BOOKS OF THEORY CLEARLY DEFINE AS A FORM OF
STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE POWER."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO DISCLOSES THAT FORMER CAPTAIN MAURICIO MENA
SANDOVAL, WHO JOINED THE GUERRILLAS IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES, HAS MADE
TELEPHONE CALLS OR SENT "PERSONAL NOTES" TO CHIEFS OR OFFICERS.

   "THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS RESORT TO THIS TYPE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
TACTICS WHEN THEY FEEL THEY ARE LOST OR DESPERATE," THE COMMUNIQUE
ADDS, REFERRING TO THE FAILURE OF THE OFFENSIVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS
LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER.
