   BOGOTA, 19 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT]
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE ANNOUNCED THE SUSPENSION OF
THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS.  ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE UNANIMOUSLY
REJECTED THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN.  THE WAVE OF POLITICAL
MURDERS HAS LEFT THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF SHOCK.  FOLLOWING ARE SOME
REACTIONS VOICED TODAY AT THE WAKE FOR THE MURDERED LIBERAL CANDIDATE:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO] THE
COUNTRY HAS BEEN ATTACKED FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS AND IT HAS NOT ACCEPTED THIS
FACT.  I HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A STATE OF SIEGE TO BE IMPLEMENTED.  AT
LAST, THE STATE OF SIEGE WAS DECLARED YESTERDAY.  I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR
THIS FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS.  GALAN WOULD NOT BE DEAD TODAY IF THE PROPOSAL WE
MADE 3 YEARS AGO WOULD HAD BEEN ACCEPTED.

   [FORMER LIBERAL COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT ALFONSO LOPEZ MICHELSEN] IT WAS RIGHT
TO CALL FOR A REACTION FROM THE COUNTRY; WE HAVE TO LEARN TO REACT, AND IT
IS NECESSARY TO DO SO. [END RECORDING]
