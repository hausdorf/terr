   GUATEMALA CITY, 18 MAY 90 (EL GRAFICO) -- [TEXT] GENERAL HECTOR
GRAMAJO MORALES HAS REPORTED THAT LAST NIGHT'S TERRORIST ACTS WERE
PROBABLY INTENDED TO DAMAGE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS, BUT
ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WENT OFF PREMATURELY.

   HE ADDED THAT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HIT A WALL OF THE AIR
FORCE INSTALLATIONS AND THE SHOCK WAVE FROM THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED SOME
BUILDINGS.

   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS, THE ATTACK WAS PROBABLY A
PROPAGANDA PLOY BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE RUDIMENTARY AND SIMILAR TO
FIRECRACKERS.

   THE TERRORIST ACTIONS SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE
IRREGULAR GROUPS ARE SHRINKING CONSIDERABLY.  EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THE
FACT THAT A SUBVERSIVE WHO SURRENDERED ON THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS
CARRYING SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS ADMITTED
THAT THEY HAD MADE A BIG EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR PRESENCE, BUT THAT
NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL RESULTED AND THEY SUFFERED MANY CASUALTIES
INSTEAD, GRAMAJO SAID.

   WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THESE TERRORIST
ACTIONS ON THE TALKS BEING HELD IN OSLO, NORWAY, GRAMAJO SAID THAT
THOSE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THE TALKS DO NOT MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
THE GROUPS THAT CARRY OUT THE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   AMONG THOSE GROUPS, THERE IS ONE FACTION THAT IS CALLED THE
INTERNATIONAL MILITANT GROUP.  THIS FACTION IS COMPRISED OF PERSONS
WHO LOVE ADVENTURE; THESE PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS
TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES.
