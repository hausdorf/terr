   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 9 JUN 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COSTA RICAN
PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS SANCHEZ HAS SAID HE IS "ALARMED" OVER THE
ASSASSINATION OF ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH, SALVADORAN MINISTER OF THE
PRESIDENCY, BY SUSPECTED URBAN GUERRILLAS EARLY THIS MORNING IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   ARIAS TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT HE FEARS "INCREASED VIOLENCE" IN THAT COUNTRY.

   RODRIGUEZ PORTH, AN INFLUENTIAL LEADER OF THE RULING NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, IS THE FIRST MINISTER TO BE ASSASSINATED BY THE
GUERRILLAS SINCE THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT BEGAN ALMOST 10 YEARS AGO.  

   RODRIGUEZ PORTH, 65, WAS KILLED AT 0815 (1415 GMT) NEAR HIS HOME IN SAN
SALVADOR, ALONG WITH TWO OF HIS BODYGUARDS, ONLY 8 DAYS AFTER TAKING OFFICE
ON 1 JUNE.

   FOR HIS PART, LUIS GUILLERMO SOLIS, CHIEF OF THE COSTA RICAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY CABINET, DENOUNCED THE ASSASSINATION AND SAID THAT "IT UNDOUBTEDLY
MEANS THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS BECOMING MORE ACUTE, AND IT MAKES
AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE POLITICAL FORCES AND THE GUERRILLAS MORE DIFFICULT."

   ACTIONS LIKE THESE "IRREPARABLY HARM" EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED
PEACE IN THAT COUNTRY, THE OFFICIAL SAID.  HE EXPRESSED HOPE, HOWEVER, THAT
THE SALVADORAN SITUATION WILL NOT DETERIORATE FURTHER.
