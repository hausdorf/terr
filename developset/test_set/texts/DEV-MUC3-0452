   BOGOTA, 9 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] IT WAS LEARNED HERE TODAY THAT A
JUDICIAL ORDER HAS FREED LUIS FERNANDO GALEANO BERRIO (ALIAS EL

MEDELLIN CARTEL AND WHO IS SUBJECT TO EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED
STATES.

   GALEANO BERRIO WAS ARRESTED ON 25 AUGUST IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT
DURING THE OFFENSIVE THE MILITARY FORCES HAVE LAUNCHED AGAINST THE

   IN ADDITION, GALEANO BERRIO IS ALSO SAID TO BE THE MASTERMIND OF
THE MURDER OF A COUNCILMAN IN CORDOBA DEPARTMENT AND OF BEING INVOLVED
IN A FRUSTRATED PLAN TO KILL AN INDIVIDUAL LINKED TO THE CALI DRUG
CARTEL, WHICH COMPETES AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL FOR THE U.S. DRUG
MARKET.
