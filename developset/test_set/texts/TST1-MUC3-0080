[JORGE ALONSO SIERRA VALENCIA] [TEXT] LIBERAL SENATOR FEDERICO ESTRADA
VELEZ WAS KIDNAPPED ON 3 APRIL AT THE CORNER OF 60TH AND 48TH STREETS
IN WESTERN MEDELLIN, ONLY 100 METERS FROM A METROPOLITAN POLICE CAI
[IMMEDIATE ATTENTION CENTER].  THE ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT LIBERAL PARTY
LEADER HAD LEFT HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ANY BODYGUARDS ONLY MINUTES EARLIER.
AS HE WAITED FOR THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TO CHANGE, THREE HEAVILY ARMED MEN
FORCED HIM TO GET OUT OF HIS CAR AND GET INTO A BLUE RENAULT.

   HOURS LATER, THROUGH ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALLS TO THE METROPOLITAN
POLICE AND TO THE MEDIA, THE EXTRADITABLES CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE KIDNAPPING.  IN THE CALLS, THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL RELEASE
THE SENATOR WITH A NEW MESSAGE FOR THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.

   LAST WEEK, FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ HAD REJECTED TALKS BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.
