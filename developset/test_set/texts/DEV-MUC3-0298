   SANTIAGO, 18 JUL 89 (TELEVISION NACIONAL DE CHILE NETWORK) --
[TEXT] INTERIOR MINISTER CARLOS CACERES TODAY STATED THAT THE
GANG-STYLE ACTION AKEN YESTERDAY BY SOME PEOPLE TO OCCUPY PRIVATE
PROPERTY WILL NOT INTIMIDATE THE GOVERNMENT.

   [BEGIN CACERES RECORDING] YESTERDAY, A WELL-ORGANIZED GROUP OF
APPROXIMATELY 300 PEOPLE ATTEMPTED TO USURP PRIVATE PROPERTY USING MOLOTOV
COCKTAILS, STONES AND FIREARMS.  THEIR ACTION CAUSED ONE UNFORTUNATE DEATH,
INJURIES, AND DAMAGE -- WHICH WERE REPORTED EARLIER -- TO THE DETRIMENT OF A
LARGE NUMBER OF POOR FAMILIES.

   IT IS PUBLICLY EVIDENT THAT THE COMMUNISTS AND THEIR CLOSEST ALLIES WERE
BEHIND THE PREPARATION, COORDINATION AND EXECUTION OF THESE CRIMINALS
ACTIONS.

   UNFORTUNATELY, ONE CANNOT FAIL TO LINK THESE ACTIONS TO THE THREATENING,
VIOLENT SPEECHES -- FOLLOWING THE STYLE USED BY THE POPULAR UNITY MEMBERS --
WITH WHICH SOME LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION COALITION OPENED THE ELECTORAL
CAMPAIGN OF THEIR CANDIDATE PATRICIO AYLWIN.

   IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE TO REGARD THESE AGGRESSIONS AS SIGNALS AND WARNINGS
OF THE INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN SOME POLITICAL
UMBRELLA GROUPS.  THESE GROUPS CONSIST OF SECTORS ADVOCATING A PEACEFUL
DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE ON THE ONE HAND, AND OTHER SECTORS THAT FOLLOW THE
LINE OF THOSE WHO IN THE PAST DESTROYED OUR TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE ON THE
OTHER HAND.

   ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS STATED ITS DECISION NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, IT CANNOT FAIL TO ANNOUNCE ITS POSITION AND TO STATE
ITS OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF A MALICIOUS AND DEMAGOGICAL RHETORIC THAT POSES A
THREAT TO PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE GOVERNMENT YIELD TO THOSE WHO TIME AND
AGAIN SEEK AND PROMOTE SUBVERSION AND TO DISRUPT OUR DEMOCRATIC
INSTITUTIONAL ORDER. [END RECORDING]
