   SAN SALVADOR, 12 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN COLONEL SIGIFREDO
OCHOA PEREZ TODAY SAID THAT THE MASTERMINDS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS'
MURDER ARE NOT "SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," BUT ARE "MUCH HIGHER IN THE
HIERARCHY."

   "REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL OR COLONEL, WHOEVER MASTERMINDED
THIS CRIME MUST BE PUNISHED," THE RANKING LEADER OF THE RULING ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY AND RETIRED OFFICER SAID DURING A
TELEVISED INTERVIEW. 

   THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE ON 16 NOVEMBER
"ARE NOT SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," HE SAID.

   "THIS ACTION INVOLVED MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OFFICERS, AND EVEN IF A GENERAL OR
COLONEL IS INVOLVED, (THE CULPRITS) MUST BE PUNISHED," HE POINTED OUT.

   HE ADDED: "WE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE AS IN THE PAST WHEN THE MASTERMINDS
ARE PROTECTED.  AS THE SAYING GOES: THE LITTLE GUYS ALWAYS PAY."

   OCHOA SAID THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT "INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE PURSUED" AND
THAT NOBODY SHOULD RECEIVE "SPECIAL TREATMENT," BECAUSE "UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHO ARE HURTING THE ARMY AND THE PRESIDENT, AND THE HIGH
COMMAND HAVE TO PURGE THEM."

   OCHOA, FORMER DEPUTY AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE STATE POWER COMPANY,
DESCRIBED AS "COURAGEOUS" THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO
PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES MASSACRED THE SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ON 7 JANUARY, CRISTIANI OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL
KILLED THE JESUITS, THEIR COOK, AND THE COOK'S 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

   HOWEVER, HE REFUSED TO REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED TO AVOID
HAMPERING THE INVESTIGATION.

   THE COLONEL SAID: "WE HOPE THAT THE NAMES WILL BE REVEALED SOON AND THAT
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE PUNISHED."

   OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OCHOA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST AN INTERNAL
STRUGGLE WITHIN THE RULING ARENA, EXPRESS AN IMPLICIT WISH TO SEE THIS
ABOMINABLE CRIME RESOLVED."

   THE RETIRED COLONEL ADDED THAT THE "COURAGEOUS" POSITION OF CRISTIANI
REGARDING THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT HIM STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS
HELPING TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT
WANTS TO PROMOTE.

   ALTHOUGH OCHOA ADMITTED THAT IN EL SALVADOR MILITARY POWER HAS BEEN BEHIND
THE REAL POWER AND THAT TRYING A MILITARY MAN HAS BEEN TABOO, HE SAID THAT
CRISTIANI "IS DETERMINED TO INTENSIFY A PURGE OF SUCH ELEMENTS FROM THE
ARMED FORCES."

   HE ALSO ADMITTED "THAT THERE ARE STILL SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN WHO BELIEVE
THAT THEY HOLD POWER AND THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR RIFLES AND THE POWER THAT
THEIR WEAPONS GIVE THEM."
