   MOSCOW (USSR), 27 NOV 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS REJETED THE PROPOSAL FOR AN IMMEDIATE
CEASE-FIRE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN],
ACCORDING TO MAURICIO SANDOVAL, SALVADORAN MINISTER OF CULTURE AND
COMMUNICATIONS.  SANDOVAL WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE U.S.  NEWS AGENCY
UPI.

   THE SALVADORAN PATRIOTS MADE THIS PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THE OAS
RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.  THE RECOMMENDATION
CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS.  BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA
CHAVEZ OFFERED HIS GOOD OFFICES.  VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES
PEREZ HAS ALSO JOINED THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP THE
VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR.  ON TUESDAY, 21 NOVEMBER, PEREZ MET WITH
OFFICIALS OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, NAMELY JUSTICE MINISTER
OSCAR SANTAMARIA AND MINISTER OF PRESIDENCY JUAN PADELA.

   ACCORDING TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, HE ALSO TALKED WITH HIS
SALVADORAN COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE PHONE.  IN THE COURSE
OF THIS TALK HE OFFERED TO HOST A CARACAS MEETING BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS.

   IT WOULD SEEM THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF CRISTIANI'S
ADMINISTRATION, ALL THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT YIELDED THE EXPECTED
FRUITS.  THE FACT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO
WORSEN THE TERROR.  WITH THIS IN MIND, THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A
LAW TO PUNISH THE OPPOSITION.  AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, CONGRESS HAS
ALREADY APPROVED ANTITERRORIST BILLS.  THESE BILLS ALLOW THE ARREST OF
PEOPLE ON SUSPICION OF ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.

   A SALVADORAN DEPUTY HAS LABELED THESE BILLS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND
CONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS.  MEANWHILE, THESE BILLS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE
ACURSED DEATH SQUADS.  AMERICAS WATCH, A HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION,
HAS REPORTED AN INCREASE OF [WORD INDISTINCT], ARRESTS OF AND THREATS
AGAINST FOREIGNERS WHO WORK FOR RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN
ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR.

   THE SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE CRUSADE
AGAINST FOREIGN MISSIONARIES IS ENCOURAGED BY THE ULTRARIGHTISTS WHO
ARE OPERATING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT
GUARANTEES THE REACTIONARIES THEIR IMPUNITY.

   DEATH SQUADS, WORKING CLOSELY WITH REACTIONARY MILITARY MEN AND THE
CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, ARE MOST CERTAINLY TO BLAME FOR THE RECENT
DISGRACEFUL MURDER OF SIX PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO THE
U.S. PUBLICATION THE BOSTON GLOBE.  THE PAPER STATES THAT THIS IS
OBVIOUS TO ALL AND THAT THE SALVADORAN REGIME AND THE YANKEE
GOVERNMENT ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT REFUSE TO ADMIT IT.

   FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THIS ATTITUDE IS REASONABLE.  WASHINGTON'S
POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR IS BASED ON THE ULTRARIGTHWING FORCES [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE BOSTON GLOBE ADDS THAT EVERY YEAR THE TAXPAYERS TAKE
OUT OF THEIR POCKETS $500 MILLION TO FINANCE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT GIVES TO EL SALVADOR.  SOME OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE
DEATH SQUADS WHICH ARE GUILTY OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITED AMID
HELLISH TORTURES.  IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF INFORMATION.

   THE THING IS THAT U.S. OFFICIALS PREFER TO LASH OUT AT THE
FICTITIOUS SHIPMENTS OF SOVIET WEAPONS TO EL SALVADOR, FICTITIOUS
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN NONE AT ALL.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USE THAT
SUCCESSIVE SALVADORAN REGIMES HAVE MADE OF U.S. AID, HAS ALWAYS BEEN
DOWNPLAYED.  HOWEVER, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WITHOUT THE HEFTY U.S.
SUBSIDIES, THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED A LONG
TIME AGO AND THE NEARLY 100,000 SALVADORANS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE
STRUGGLE, WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.
