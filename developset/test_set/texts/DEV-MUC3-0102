   SAN SALVADOR, 2 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] RADIO CADENA
YSKL'S NEWS CENTER RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] SPOKESMEN.  ACCORDING TO THEM, THE
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN HAS BEEN SUSPENDED.

   THE INFORMATION SAYS THAT FMLN GENERAL COMMAND MADE THE DECISION GIVEN
THE LATEST ACTIONS CARRIED OUT IN THE COUNTRY--SPECIFICALLY THE ATTACK ON
FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], WHICH RESULTED IN
THE DEATH OF 10 UNION MEMBERS.

   WE REPEAT:  THE FMLN HAS CALLED US TO REPORT THAT THE MEETING SCHEDULED
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, HAS BEEN
SUSPENDED GIVEN THE EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT DAYS, PARTICULARLY
THE KILLING OF 10 LABOR UNION MEMBERS AT THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS ON
TUESDAY, 31 OCTOBER.

   WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION HAS TEMPORARILY
SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THE PROTECTION OF
CIVIC-CULTURAL AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COUNTRY.
