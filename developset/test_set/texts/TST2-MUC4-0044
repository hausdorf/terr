   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 27 OCT 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE ATTACK IN WHICH
FIVE VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AT THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS
BEEN BLAMED, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, ON COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND
DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA.

   VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ BLAMED COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKING GANGS FOR THE ATTACK -- IN WHICH FIVE GUARDS WERE KILLED
-- PERPETRATED ON 26 OCTOBER IN THE BORDER STATE OF APURE AGAINST A
NATIONAL GUARD PATROL IN THE AREA.

   REFERRING LAST NIGHT TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS, PEREZ SAID THIS
IS "A PROVOCATION FOR VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO EXTEND
THEIR CLAWS TO OUR COUNTRY."

   HOWEVER, JORGE ROMERO, GOVERNOR OF THE BORDER STATE OF TACHIRA,
WHICH BORDERS THE STATE OF APURE, MAINTAINED THIS WAS AN "ATTACK WITH
VERY POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES" PERPETRATED BY "MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN
GUERRILLAS, PRESUMABLY FROM THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY,
AGAINST A NATIONAL GUARD JEEP."

   ACCORDING TO ROMERO, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED DURING THE PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE EXPLOSIVES THAT KILLED THE FIVE SOLDIERS WERE
BURIED IN A ROAD NEAR CUTUFI, AND SET OFF BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE
MILITARY VEHICLE PASSED BY.

   LAST NIGHT, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY ORDERED THE ARREST OF FIVE ALLEGED
COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, WHOM IT BLAMED FOR THE ATTACK.  HOWEVER, THE
ATTACKERS REPORTEDLY CROSSED THE BORDER INTO COLOMBIA.
