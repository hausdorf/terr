   BOGOTA, 30 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [TEXT] LAST
NIGHT'S TERRORIST TARGET WAS THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT. FOUR
POWERFUL ROCKETS WERE GOING TO EXPLODE VERY CLOSE TO THE TANKS WHERE
300,000 GALLONS OF THE SO-CALLED CASTILLE CRUDE, USED TO OPERATE THE
BOILERS, IS STORED. THE WATCHMEN ON DUTY REPORTED THAT AT 2030 THEY
SAW A MAN AND A WOMAN LEAVING A SMALL SUITCASE NEAR THE FENCE THAT
SURROUNDS THE PLANT. THE WATCHMEN EXCHANGED FIRE WITH THE TERRORISTS
WHO FLED LEAVING BEHIND THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL THAT ALSO INCLUDED
DYNAMITE AND GRENADE ROCKET LAUNCHERS. METROPOLITAN POLICE PERSONNEL
SPECIALIZING IN EXPLOSIVES, DEFUSED THE ROCKETS. SOME 100 PEOPLE WERE
WORKING INSIDE THE PLANT.

   THE DAMAGE THE ROCKETS WOULD HAVE CAUSED HAD THEY BEEN ACTIVATED
CANNOT BE ESTIMATED BECAUSE THE CARIBE SODA FACTORY AND THE GUAYABAL
RESIDENTIAL AREA WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN AFFECTED.

   THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT HAS RECEIVED THREATS IN THE PAST AND
MAXIMUM SECURITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRACTICED IN THE AREA. SECURITY WAS
STEPPED UP LAST NIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE LIQUEUR INDUSTRY IS THE
LARGEST FOREIGN EXCHANGE PRODUCER FOR THE DEPARTMENT.
