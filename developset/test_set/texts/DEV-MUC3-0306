   BOGOTA, 20 JUL 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THAT THE
ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION-CAMILIST UNION (UC-ELN) TODAY CARRIED OUT ITS
SIXTH ATTACK THIS YEAR AGAINST THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE, WHICH LINKS THE
COLOMBIAN TOWNS OF ORITO AND TUMACO NEAR THE COLOMBIAN-ECUADORAN BORDER.  

   THE REBELS USED EXPLOSIVES TO BLOW UP 1 METER OF PIPELINE. THIS IS THE
REBELS' 33D ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL NETWORK IN 1989.  THE
AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL SPILL BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE
ATTACK, NO OIL WAS BEING PUMPED THROUGH THE PIPELINE.

   A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UC-ELN CALLED THE CALI
MEDIA TO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

   THE UC-ELN IS ATTACKING COLOMBIA'S OIL PIPELINES AS A WAY TO PRESSURE THE
GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THE OIL INDUSTRY AND TO SIGN MORE FAVORABLE
CONTRACTS WITH MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANIES. THIS YEAR ALONE, THE UC-ELN
LAUNCHED 25 ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE, THE LONGEST IN
COLOMBIA. THE ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON- COVENAS PIPELINE HAVE CAUSED
APPROXIMATE $150 MILLION IN DAMAGE.

   IF THE SIX ATTACKS ON THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE AND THE TWO ON THE
DINA-SALGAR OIL PIPELINE ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, LOSSES AMOUNT TO
APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. THE DINA-SALGAR PIPELINE CARRIES CRUDE OIL FROM
THE OIL FIELDS IN TOLIMA TO THE REFINERY IN BARRANCABERMEJA.
