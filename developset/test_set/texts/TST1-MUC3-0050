JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, AND PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES, PRESIDENT OF THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL (CSUCA), HAVE CONDEMNED THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS IN EL SALVADOR AT DAWN TODAY.

   MCGRATH, WHO DESCRIBED THE MULTIPLE ASSASSINATION AS "MONSTROUS,"
POINTED OUT THAT "IT IS EVERYBODY'S DUTY, ESPECIALLY OF THAT COUNTRY'S
GOVERNMENT, TO IDENTIFY, ARREST, AND TRY THE CULPRITS AND THOSE WHO
ORDERED THE ACTION."

   THIS "MUST NOT ONLY BE A JUST TRIAL OF THEM, BUT ALSO A MEANS TO
ELOQUENTLY EXPRESS THE REJECTION OF THE ENTIRE SOCIETY, WHICH CALLS
ITSELF CHRISTIAN, AGAINST SUCH A CRUEL AND UNJUST CRIME THAT REVEALS
ABSOLUTE CONTEMPT FOR HUMAN LIFE," A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ARCHBISHOP
MCGRATH STATES.

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES FROM EL SALVADOR'S JESUIT CURIA, THE SPANISH
JESUIT IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF EL SALVADOR'S CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY (UCA), FIVE OTHER PRIESTS, AND TWO SALVADORAN WOMEN WERE
MURDERED AT DAWN TODAY BY MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.

   IN THE OPINION OF SPANISH BISHOP JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, SECRETARY OF
PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE AND RECTOR OF SANTA MARIA LA ANTIGUA
UNIVERSITY, "THESE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED WITH MALICE AND IN
COLD BLOOD."  "THEY ARE CERTAINLY TO BE CONDEMNED, REGARDLESS OF WHO
CARRIED THEM OUT," HE ADDED.

   CSUCA PRESIDENT PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES DESCRIBED AS "ABOMINABLE"
AND "REPREHENSIBLE" THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ADAMES, WHO IS ALSO RECTOR OF PANAMA'S NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,
REJECTED THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE "AS A MEANS TO REACH AGREEMENTS IN
EL SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED."

   CSUCA WILL ASK THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO DECLARE UCA A
"SANCTUARY" OR "NEUTRAL ZONE" TO TREAT THOSE WOUNDED IN THE CLASHES
BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE 11
NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER TOWNS, ADAMES POINTED OUT.

   CSUCA COORDINATOR AND SALVADORAN GUILLERMO GALVAN SAID TODAY IN SAN

BRING ABOUT A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND STEP UP EFFORTS
TO PREVENT "MASSACRES" AND "SELECTIVE MURDERS."
