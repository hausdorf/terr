   CLANDESTINE, 14 SEP 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATEMENT] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN] [TEXT] TODAY, 14 SEPTEMBER, THE
CHIEFS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY ARCE BATTALION STATE THAT THE FMLN HAS
BROKEN THE UNILATERAL TRUCE.  THE ARCE BATTALION CHIEFS SAID THAT
CLASHES TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA OF PERQUIN AND ADMITTED THAT TWO
SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN THE CLASHES.

   IN REGARD TO THOSE STATEMENTS, WE CONSIDER THAT:

   1. FOR 7 YEARS AND AFTER HAVING BEEN EXPELLED FROM THAT AREA, THE
GOVERNMENT FORCES DO NOT HAVE FIXED POSITIONS NORTH OF MORAZAN
DEPARTMENT.  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR TRUCE, ARCE BATTALION TROOPS
HAVE BEGUN TO ENTER OUR TERRITORIES.  THUS, THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED
BY THE ARCE BATTALION ARE A RESULT OF ACTIONS IN WHICH THE FMLN ACTED
IN DEFENSE OF ITS FORCES.

   2. ALL ENEMY UNITS THAT CROSS THE TOROLA RIVER DURING AN OPERATION
[WORD INDISTINCT] BECOME A MILITARY TARGET AND MORE SO IN THIS CASE,
BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES BOMBED AND STRAFFED PERQUIN CIVILIANS, AMONG
WHOM THERE HAVE BEEN CASUALTIES.

   3. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCE DURING THE
ESTABLISHED DAYS JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING, ALTHOUGH UP UNTIL NOW THE
REGIME HAS FAILED TO EXPRESS ANY GOODWILL; HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE
EVACUATION OF THE WAR DISABLED; AND HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF
BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.
