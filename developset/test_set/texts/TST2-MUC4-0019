   SAN SALVADOR, 26 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MILTON GRIMALDI] [TEXT]
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT DESPITE THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST
SALVADORANS, HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE REBELS.
HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A
COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING
WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE
THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL
ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK
THIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE
FMLN:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT
WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN
COMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS
ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE,
INVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE
HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS ACTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE
COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH
ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION.
THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR
PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK
AND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS
FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.

   WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE
WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL
ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE
COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION
IS FULLY FORMED.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS
COMMISSION?

   [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE
REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION
AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE
CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS
TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD
THIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO
PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE
POLITICAL COMMISSION.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE
ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR
INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE
OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE
HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF
GOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER
WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT
OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC
FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN
VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE
LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. [END RECORDING]

   CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO
HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT
THE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP
MURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.
