   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] GOODBYE [AIR FORCE COMMANDER] GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE
HOPE FOR MASS KILLERS.  GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS
THE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT
WITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN
OF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL
SALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.

   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE
AIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE
COUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,
TOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE
GENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN
EL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS
AND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE
IMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN
EL SALVADOR.

   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE
OF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER
EUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE
WOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS
MOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,
MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT
MURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT
WHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF
GENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?

   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE
PAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT
REBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED
HAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.

   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN
ACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES
GENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO
ACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE
TOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A
POLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR
SECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.
BUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR
DEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL
OPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT
SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS
NOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS
IT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT
THEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:
TO STOP THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF
THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG
DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS
AND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING
FOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN
OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER
THIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.

   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL
BEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S
SCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS
MACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE
APPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE
OBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES
OF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO
LEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,
COMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,
THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE
WRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,
INDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND
THE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE
PEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY
BOMBINGS.

   ROME (ITALY), 11 JAN 90 -- [INTERVIEW WITH DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE
LEADER RUBEN ZAMORA BY ALESSANDRO OPPES] [EXCERPT] [PASSAGE OMITTED]
[OPPES] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS
DESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE
MASSACRE [OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS] AS "A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION."
BASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO
END INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD?

   [ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF
THE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A
GOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE
ALSO TAKEN.  FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE:  THIS IS
THE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED.  SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED
BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO,
FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS.

   [OPPES] HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED
INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION
"DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY."

   [ZAMORA] I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT
FATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION.  OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE
DIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE
CIVILIANS.  POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT
PRACTICE.  FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR.  THE
ARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE
INNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS.

   [OPPES] YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN
SAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN
EXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN
NOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

   [ZAMORA] THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY,
THE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL
SALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION
TO THIS END.  BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS:
THESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   [OPPES] WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS?

   [ZAMORA] NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY.  THE GUERRILLA
OFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A
REVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES.  IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
THE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE
MILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.S.
MILITARY STRATEGY.)  WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING
THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS
STANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE
WILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  AT THE END OF
NOVEMBER THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE
OFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE
CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF A CHANGING SITUATION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
TODAY DEPLORED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI
COLINDRES THIS MORNING IN GUATEMALA.

   NATIONAL INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "IT IS
REGRETTABLE," ADDING THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY
EFFORTS THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON THE CASE.

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES FROM HIS PARTY, HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES, ASSISTANT
SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) DISAPPEARED TODAY IN
GUATEMALA WHEN THE VEHICLE IN WHICH HE WAS TRAVELING WAS INTERCEPTED BY
HEAVILY ARMED MEN WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHING.

   AN MNR SPOLESMAN REPORTED THAT OQUELI COLINDRES WAS "KIDNAPPED" AS HE WAS
HEADING TO THE AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY TO TAKE A FLIGHT TO NICARAGUA,
WHERE HE WOULD JOIN A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION THAT IS CURRENTLY
IN THAT COUNTRY TO OBSERVE THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.

   MNR SPOKESMEN SAID THAT THE GUATEMALAN POLICE FOUND THE VEHICLE IN WHICH
OQUELI WAS TRAVELING WITH A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
WITHOUT ITS OCCUPANTS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN COLONEL SIGIFREDO
OCHOA PEREZ TODAY SAID THAT THE MASTERMINDS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS'
MURDER ARE NOT "SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," BUT ARE "MUCH HIGHER IN THE
HIERARCHY."

   "REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL OR COLONEL, WHOEVER MASTERMINDED
THIS CRIME MUST BE PUNISHED," THE RANKING LEADER OF THE RULING ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY AND RETIRED OFFICER SAID DURING A
TELEVISED INTERVIEW. 

   THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE ON 16 NOVEMBER
"ARE NOT SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," HE SAID.

   "THIS ACTION INVOLVED MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OFFICERS, AND EVEN IF A GENERAL OR
COLONEL IS INVOLVED, (THE CULPRITS) MUST BE PUNISHED," HE POINTED OUT.

   HE ADDED: "WE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE AS IN THE PAST WHEN THE MASTERMINDS
ARE PROTECTED.  AS THE SAYING GOES: THE LITTLE GUYS ALWAYS PAY."

   OCHOA SAID THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT "INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE PURSUED" AND
THAT NOBODY SHOULD RECEIVE "SPECIAL TREATMENT," BECAUSE "UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHO ARE HURTING THE ARMY AND THE PRESIDENT, AND THE HIGH
COMMAND HAVE TO PURGE THEM."

   OCHOA, FORMER DEPUTY AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE STATE POWER COMPANY,
DESCRIBED AS "COURAGEOUS" THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO
PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES MASSACRED THE SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ON 7 JANUARY, CRISTIANI OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL
KILLED THE JESUITS, THEIR COOK, AND THE COOK'S 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

   HOWEVER, HE REFUSED TO REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED TO AVOID
HAMPERING THE INVESTIGATION.

   THE COLONEL SAID: "WE HOPE THAT THE NAMES WILL BE REVEALED SOON AND THAT
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE PUNISHED."

   OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OCHOA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST AN INTERNAL
STRUGGLE WITHIN THE RULING ARENA, EXPRESS AN IMPLICIT WISH TO SEE THIS
ABOMINABLE CRIME RESOLVED."

   THE RETIRED COLONEL ADDED THAT THE "COURAGEOUS" POSITION OF CRISTIANI
REGARDING THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT HIM STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS
HELPING TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT
WANTS TO PROMOTE.

   ALTHOUGH OCHOA ADMITTED THAT IN EL SALVADOR MILITARY POWER HAS BEEN BEHIND
THE REAL POWER AND THAT TRYING A MILITARY MAN HAS BEEN TABOO, HE SAID THAT
CRISTIANI "IS DETERMINED TO INTENSIFY A PURGE OF SUCH ELEMENTS FROM THE
ARMED FORCES."

   HE ALSO ADMITTED "THAT THERE ARE STILL SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN WHO BELIEVE
THAT THEY HOLD POWER AND THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR RIFLES AND THE POWER THAT
THEIR WEAPONS GIVE THEM."

   GUATEMALA CITY, 13 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GUATEMALAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY CONDEMNED TODAY THE ASSASSINATION OF LEFTIST SALVADORAN LEADER
HECTOR OQUELI AND GUATEMALAN POLITICAL LEADER GILDA FLORES.

   BOTH BODIES WERE FOUND TODAY IN AN AREA NEAR GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR
BORDER AFTER THE VICTIMS WERE KIDNAPPED IN GUATEMALA CITY YESTERDAY.

   A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE "REGRETS AND CONDEMNS" THE ASSASSINATION OF
OQUELI, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL FOR LATIN AMERICA
AND THE CARIBBEAN, AND DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), A LEFTIST MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR.

   "WE DEEPLY REGRET THE DEATHS OF TWO VALUABLE PERSONS, AND WE CONDEMN THIS
ACT OF VIOLENCE," THE NOTE ADDS.

   THE DOCUMENT IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL REACTION TO THE KIDNAPPING AND
ASSASSINATION OF BOTH LEADERS.

   GILDA FLORES WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY (PSD)
OF GUATEMALA, WHOSE SECRETARY GENERAL MARIO SOLORZANO REPORTED THAT
"SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS" ARE CARRYING OUT ACTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO SOLORZANO, THE INCIDENT "SHOWS THERE IS COOPERATION BETWEEN
PARAMILITARY GROUPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES," BECAUSE THE PERPETRATORS KNEW OF
OQUELI'S ARRIVAL "AND THEY STAGED AN ENTIRE OPERATION TO KIDNAP HIM."

   THE BODIES OF THE POLITICAL LEADERS WERE FOUND EARLY THIS MORNING WITH
SHOTS THROUGH THE TEMPLE IN THE GUATEMALAN TOWN OF JALPATAGUA, NEAR THE
BORDER WITH EL SALVADOR, OQUELI'S RELATIVES TOLD EFE IN EL SALVADOR.

   OQUELI ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA LAST THURSDAY.  ON FRIDAY MORNING, WHILE ON
HIS WAY TO LA AURORA AIRPORT TO CATCH A PLANE TO NICARAGUA, HE WAS KIDNAPPED
BY "HEAVILY ARMED MEN," ACCORDING TO THE MNR.

NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK LAST NIGHT, THE GOVERNMENT REVEALED
THE RESULTS OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS ON THE MURDER OF MSGR ARNULFO
ROMERO; HOWEVER, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID AT NOON TODAY ONLY THE FOURTH
CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVIDENCE AGAINST ANY PERSON
IS LEGAL:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] SINCE I
DO NOT KNOW THEIR CONTENT, I CANNOT GIVE AN OPINION ON THE MATTER.
HOWEVER, IF FROM THOSE RECORDS OR THE VIDEO ONE CAN DETERMINE THERE IS
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THE CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST MSGR ROMERO, I
WILL UNQUESTIONABLY REQUEST THAT EVIDENCE AND SUBMIT IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE
FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT.  I BELIEVE EVIDENCE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SPECULATE
OR SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY PROMOTED.  IF PERTINENT EVIDENCE EXISTS, IT MUST
BE SUBMITTED TO THE CORRESPONDING JUDGE, WHO IS THE EXCLUSIVE LEGAL
AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH IT AND, AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS, DETERMINE THE
VALIDITY OF THE EVIDENCE. [END RECORDING]

   NEVERTHELESS, MSGR ROMERO'S CASE HAS BEGUN TO HAVE THE ELEMENTS IT HAD
LACKED FOR MORE THAN 8 YEARS.  THE LEGAL EVIDENCE MUST CONTAIN A SERIES OF
CONDITIONS, AND ONLY THE JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE VALUE OR
NOT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE VIDEO
FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT EVIDENCE.  THE CONTENTS OF THE VIDEO MUST BE REAFFIRMED
BY THE PERSONS WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PARTICIPATED IN THE PREPARATION,
AND THE ACCURACY OF THE CONTENTS NARRATED IN THAT VIDEO MUST BE LEGALLY
DETERMINED. [END RECORDING]

   GARCIA ALVARADO ADDED THAT THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE DECIDED A FEW
HOURS AGO TO SUMMON FORMER ATTORNEY ROBERTO GIRON FLORES AND THE OFFICIALS
JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA AND GERARDO LE CHEVALIER TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THEY
CLAIM TO HAVE ON THE CASE.  BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFICIALS, THE LATTER TWO MUST
MAKE SWORN STATEMENTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE JUDGE
IN CHARGE OF THE CASE HAS ISSUED RESOLUTIONS ORDERING THE SUMMONS OF IVON
FLORES AND SWORN STATEMENTS FROM THE TWO OFFICIALS MENTIONED. [END

   THESE NEW RESOLUTIONS OF THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ON MSGR
ROMERO'S CASE WERE ISSUED AT THE REQUEST OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,
WHICH DEMONSTRATES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, THAT HE IS NOT AN
UNDERTAKER OF TRIALS, MUCH LESS OF PEOPLE.

   VICE PRESIDENT ANTONIO CASTILLO CLARAMOUNT SAID THE SUPREME COURT OF
JUSTICE HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THE MURDERERS OF MSGR ROMERO,
INCLUDING MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON.  THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO INSISTED THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THOSE GUILTY OF THE
MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO BE PUNISHED.  HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THE SUPREME COURT
MUST ACT.  HE SAID THE INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE AND GATHER ALL THE
EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THIS CASE, WHICH OCCURRED IN MARCH 1980.

CASES, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO POSITIVE RESULTS.

   THE TWO BOMBS EXPLODED ONLY MINUTES APART AND CAUSED MINOR DAMAGE
TO THE WALLS OF THE TWO PREMISES.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES.

   ACCORDING TO SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BOMB SQUAD OF THE LOCAL POLICE,
THE TWO BOMBS WERE PLANTED WITH THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSE OF INTIMIDATING
THE OWNERS OF THE PREMISES.

   THIS AFTERNOON SOURCES CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION ANNOUNCED THAT
BOTH ATTACKS HAD THE INTENTION OF "FRIGHTENING" TORRE ALDAY AND
ROSSMAN, WHO WAS DIRECTOR OF THE PROVINCIAL BANK OF SANTA FE DURING
GOVERNOR JOSE VERNET'S TENURE.

   IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT BOTH TORRE ALDAY AND ROSSMAN ARE LINKED TO

   GUATEMALA CITY, 20 MAY 88 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALA'S
CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION "SECRET ANTICOMMUNIST ARMY" (ESA) HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WEDNESDAY'S TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE RESIDENCE
AND OFFICE OF ALEKSANDR TRUSHIN, TASS CORRESPONDENT IN GUATEMALA.

   AN ESA BULLETIN DISTRIBUTED TO THE NEWS MEDIA STATES THAT THE
ATTACK AGAINST THE SOVIET NEWS AGENCY "WAS TO EXPRESS REJECTION OF THE
SOCIALIST-LEANING MEASURES" ADOPTED BY THE VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO
GOVERNMENT.

   THE DOCUMENT EXPLAINS THAT "THIS IS A WARNING," BECAUSE IF ARREST
WARRANTS ARE ISSUED FOR THE FIVE CIVILIANS INVOLVED IN THE ABORTIVE 11
MAY COUP, "ACTIONS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE
GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY," WHICH IS THE RULING PARTY.

   THE ATTACK, CARRIED OUT WITH TWO BOMBS, WAS PERPETRATED AGAINST THE
SOVIET NEWSMAN'S HOME, LOCATED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA SOUTH OF THIS
CITY.  THIS OCCURRED ON 18 MAY.

   THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WERE HURLED FROM AN AUTOMOBILE.  IT DESTROYED
AN ENTRANCE AND WINDOWS OF THE HOME AS WELL AS TRUSHIN'S CAR.
HOWEVER, NEITHER TRUSHIN NOR HIS WIFE WERE INJURED.

   THE COMMUNIQUE BY ESA, A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT EMERGED IN
THE 1960'S, ADDS THAT IT "WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION
HAS BEEN STOPPED AND ITS DEFEAT ACHIEVED."

   IT ALSO SAYS THAT "THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING REVOLUTION.
IF IT WANTS WAR, IT WILL HAVE WAR BECAUSE WE ARE READY TO DIE AND TO
FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM ANY TIME."

   THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY COMMANDERS "UBICO TOROKZIK" AND "RAFAEL
NETANAGIUHI," SAYS THAT DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMEJO,
FOREIGN MINISTER ALFONSO CABRERA, AND PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO
PLANNED THE COUP.

   ACCORDING TO THIS COMMUNIQUE, IN THE RECENT TRIP TO CUBA BY RAQUEL
BLANDON, WIFE OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AREVALO, SHE MET WITH LIBYAN AHMAD
MUSTAFA [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] "TO ASK HIM FOR ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR
THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1990."

   ESA IS OPPOSED TO THE ISSUANCE OF ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST MARIO
DAVID GARCIA, DANILO ROCA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, GUSTAVO ANZUETO VIELMAN,
AND MARIO CASTEJON.  THESE ARE THE CIVILIANS WHOM THE CEREZO AREVALO
GOVERNMENT HAS ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT.

   THIS GROUP STRESSES THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS A "PLOY PROMOTED BY GEN
HECTOR GRAMEJO.  THAT IS THE BASEST THING THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER
COULD HAVE DONE: TO SELL HIMSELF AND HIS MILITARY COLLEAGUES."

   ESA MEMBERS DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS "GUATEMALA'S PROGRESSIVE
PATRIOTS," AND THEY REAFFIRM THAT THE ATTACK ON THE TASS MISSION "WAS
A WARNING."

   LA PAZ, 26 MAY 89 (LA RED PANAMERICANA) -- [TEXT] INTERIOR MINISTER
EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN HAS DISCARDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW, QUOTE,
TERRORIST OR GUERRILLA GROUP, UNQUOTE, OUTBREAK IN THE COUNTRY. HE
MADE THIS STATEMENT REFERRING TO THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. MISSIONARIES
LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

   TO REMIND THE PEOPLE OF THIS CASE, DURING THE EVENING OF 24 MAY TWO U.S.
CITIZENS, WHO BELONGED TO A RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION, WERE MURDERED BY A
SELF-STYLED ZARATE WILKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION [FAL] GROUP IN DOWNTOWN
LA PAZ.

   THE INTERIOR MINISTER ADDED THAT THIS ALLEGED ORGANIZATION THAT CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER, HAS NO TIES WITH THE PERUVIAN SHINING PATH
TERRORIST GROUP.  

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PEREZ BELTRAN] TO THIS MOMENT, AND DUE TO THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THE CASE, I DO NOT DARE TO ADMIT THE EXISTANCE OF ANY
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO TERRORIST GROUPS. IF THE SHINING PATH IS
OPERATING IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS IN FACT SHINING PATH
THAT IS COMMITTING THESE CRIMES.

   WE CAN SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY IN THE
1960'S, WHEN IT DID NOT HIDE ITS IDENTITY. THIS WAS AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP.
THEY ARRIVED IN BOLIVIA WITHOUT HIDING THEIR INTERNATIONAL IDENTITY, AND
THERE ARE MANY BOLIVIANS WHO CAN TELL US ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY.

   NOW, IF THIS CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE SHINING PATH, THEN IT WAS
COMMITTED BY THE SHINING PATH AND NOT BY THE ZARATE WILKA GROUP. I DO NOT
WANT TO DISCARD THIS POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER, I DO NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT AS
SOMETHING VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. OUR OBLIGATION, AS MEMBERS OF THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IS TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OBVIOUS, FULLY
VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. [END RECORDING]

   THE INTERIOR MINISTER ADDED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SELF-STYLED
FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP AND OF SHINING PATH MEMBERS IN BOLIVIA IS DOUBTFUL,
BECAUSE IN THE CRIMINAL CASES RECORDED IN COCHABAMBA AND IN ORURO RECENTLY,
THE POLICE DISCOVERED THAT COMMON CRIMINALS, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE LINKED TO
THE WORLD OF DRUG ADDITION AND DRUG TRAFFICKING WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN
THOSE CRIMES.

   REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES IN LA PAZ LAST WEDNESDAY,
THE INTERIOR MINISTER STATED THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN DETAINED, BUT THAT THE
INVESTIGATIONS BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES CONTINUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT] 

   [PEREZ BELTRAN] NO. WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THE EXISTENCE OF A TERRORIST
GROUP IN BOLIVIA.  

   [REPORTER] AND WHAT ABOUT THESE MURDER CASES?

   [PEREZ BELTRAN] I DO NOT KNOW. MANY PEOPLE CAN BE HIDING BEHIND THIS
ZARATE WILKA GROUP. WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ZARATE WILKA GROUP.
WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL LEANINGS, OR WHAT PARTY IS
BEHIND THIS GROUP. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A COMMON CRIME, OR MAYBE NOT.

   BUT WE CANNOT JUST GO OUT AND SAY: YES, THIS GROUP LAST NIGHT
MACHINEGUNNED THESE PEOPLE, THAT THEY ESCAPED, ETC. THIS WOULD MEAN A VERY
IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WANTS TO DEAL WITH THIS CASE AS
SERIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT CAUSE THE PEOPLE TO PANIC.

   WE MUST DO SOMETHING FOR THE COUNTRY. WE SHOULD UNITE OUR FORCES, ALL
COALITION PARTIES, THE RULING PARTY, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE ARMED FORCES,
THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND ALL BOLIVIANS, TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS WOULD
REPRESENT A REAL BOLIVIAN STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE WHO INTEND TO DISRUPT OUR
PROCESS OF LIBERTY, TO FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OF THE
FATHERLAND. [END RECORDING]

DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY OF COLOMBIA (DAS,
SECRET POLICE), BLAMED "NARCOMILITARY" ORGANIZATIONS FOR A CAR-BOMB ATTACK
FROM WHICH HE ESCAPED UNHARMED TODAY.

   MAZA STATED THIS WHEN HE READ AN OPEN LETTER HE ADDRESSED TO THE NATION'S
ATTORNEY GENERAL (TOP PROSECUTOR) ALFONSO GOMEZ MENDEZ A FEW HOURS AFTER THE
ATTACK.  IN THAT LETTER, MAZA STATES HE HAS ATTACHED "OVERWHELMING PROOF"
ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE ATTACKERS.

   IN THE TERRORIST ACTION, WHICH TOOK PLACE IN A DOWNTOWN BOGOTA STREET AT
1210 GMT, FOUR PEDESTRIANS WERE KILLED AND SEVERAL OTHERS INJURED.

   GEN MAZA POINTED OUT THAT ON 25 MAY, THE NATIONAL POLICE ARRESTED ARMY
CAPTAIN LUIS JAVIER WULMEN CAMARGO, RETIRED, AND CIVILIAN JOSE JAVIER RIVERA
AND FOUND DOCUMENTS LINKING RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS WITH TODAY'S
ATTACK AND OTHER POLITICAL CRIMES.

   MAZA ADDED THAT THE DEPUTY NATIONAL POLICE DIRECTOR INFORMED HIM
YESTERDAY THAT ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS FOUND ON THE RETIRED CAPTAIN IS THE
"PLAN" [LIBRETO] OF THE ATTACK THAT WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST HIM TODAY.

   THAT DOCUMENT IS TITLED "CONFIDENTIAL REPORT FOR MR DE LAS FLORES."  THE
GENERAL ASKED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CONDUCT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE
ARRESTED MEN AND THE DOCUMENTS FOUND ON THEM; HE URGED THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL TO GUARENTEE THE SAFETY OF THE TWO ARRESTED MEN, BECAUSE "THE PLAN
FAILED AND ATTEMPTS AGAINST THEIR LIVES CANNOT BE RULED OUT."

   IN HIS LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, MAZA STATES THAT THE PARAMILITARY
GROUPS ARE FINANCED BY THE "MEDELLIN CARTEL" DRUG- TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION
AND GROUPS MOVED BY POLITICAL INTERESTS THAT FREQUENTLY RESORT TO "BRIBING"
AND "CORRUPTING OFFICIALS."

   THE MILITARY MAN EXPRESSED HIS CONFIDENCE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT
THE TWO ARRESTED MEN AND THE MATERIAL FOUND ON THEM WILL HELP DETERMINE THE
IDENTITY OF THE PLANNERS AND PERPETRATORS -- NOT ONLY OF THIS ATTACK, BUT OF
MANY POLITICAL CRIMES.

   HE ADDED THAT THE INCIDENT CALLS FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HIMSELF TO
CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATION AND; THUS, HE PREFERS THAT DAS AND OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS ABSTAIN FROM PARTICIPATING.

   "I WANT JUSTICE TO BE SERVED; I WANT THE TRUTH," MAZA TOLD THE REPORTERS
AFTER READING THE LETTER.

AND WILL NOT LEAD TO PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT.

   WE HOPE THIS CONDEMNABLE ACT WILL NOT BE FOLLOWED BY AN ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE AND REVENGE THAT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO FURTHER POLARIZE SALVADORAN
SOCIETY.  THE PDC EXPRESSES ITS CONDOLENCES TO THE REPUBLIC'S GOVERNMENT,

POLITICAL AND PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS THAT IS CURRENTLY AFFLICTING

DR ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH.

   [LOPEZ] DR COLINDRES, DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ESCALATION
OF VIOLENCE BY THE EXTREME RIGHT?

   [COLINDRES] WE HOPE REASON WILL PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS
OR ANY OTHER INCIDENT SHOULD NOT LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, BECAUSE
THAT WOULD ONLY RESULT IN MORE BLOODLETTING AMONG THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  I
BELIEVE WE MUST NOT FALL FOR THE TRAP OF VIOLENCE THAT WOULD ONLY DESTROY US.

   [LOPEZ] IT IS PRESUMED THAT THIS ACTION INVOLVED LEFTIST URBAN COMMANDOS
OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT POLITICAL GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE?

   [COLINDRES] LET US WAIT AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE
BEEN THE FMLN OR ULTRARIGHTIST FACTIONS SEEKING FURTHER POLARIZATION AND
BLOODLETTING.  WE DO NOT WANT TO PASS JUDGMENT YET.  REGARDLESS OF WHO DID
IT, THIS IS AN ASSASSINATION, WHICH IS NOT THE PROPER WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
AMONG SALVADORANS.  

   [LOPEZ] IN THE PDC'S OPINION, WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES
IN THE WAKE OF DR RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S ASSASSINATION?  

   [COLINDRES] I BELIEVE THE ARMED FORCES MUST CONTINUE THEIR POLICY OF
PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE THIS IMPLIES
RESPECTING THE LAW AND STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTION OF THE ARMED FORCES.
THEY HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND CALM OF THE
ENTIRE POPULATION.

   [LOPEZ] WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING?

THEIR CAMP.  

   [VARGAS] WHAT IS IN THE COMMUNIQUE, MAYOR?

   [MORALES] THE COMMUNIQUE IS BEING HELD BY THE MAYOR OF SAN CARLOS.  IN
ANY EVENT, WE WANT TO SPEAK TO THE GOVERNMENT SECRETARY TOMORROW OR THIS

RETURNED TO COLOMBIA TODAY TO URGE THE CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION (ELN) TO JOIN THE PEACE PROCESS BEING PROMOTED BY THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT.  

   JARAMILLO, A 35-YEAR-OLD LEGISLATOR, REPLACED JAIME PARDO LEAL AS UP
PRESIDENT AFTER PARDO LEAL WAS ASSASSINATED IN OCTOBER 1987.  JARAMILLO HAD
LEFT THE COUNTRY AFTER RECEIVING MANY DEATH THREATS.

   THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE
PEACE PROPOSALS FORMULATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO
AND INSTEAD HAS INCREASED ITS ATTACKS ON THE COUNTRY'S PETROLEUM
INSTALLATIONS TO DEMAND THE NATIONALIZATION OF THAT INDUSTRY.

   JARAMILLO ASKED THE ELN TO STOP ITS VIOLENT ACTIONS, WHICH, HE SAID, DO
NOT IN ANY WAY BENEFIT COLOMBIA.  

   THE LEFTIST LEADER SAID HE IS WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
DEVELOPMENT AND ADDED THAT "THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS
IMPROVED."

   THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION, HE SAID, HAS BEGUN TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT
CITIZENS.

   "MORE SECURITY MEASURES ARE NEEDED, BUT SOME MEASURES ARE BEING ADOPTED,"
JARAMILLO SAID.  HE STRESSED THAT IF ALL THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS DECIDE TO
HOLD A SINCERE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE, IT WOULD BE VERY POSITIVE FOR THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN CACERES RECORDING] YESTERDAY, A WELL-ORGANIZED GROUP OF
APPROXIMATELY 300 PEOPLE ATTEMPTED TO USURP PRIVATE PROPERTY USING MOLOTOV
COCKTAILS, STONES AND FIREARMS.  THEIR ACTION CAUSED ONE UNFORTUNATE DEATH,
INJURIES, AND DAMAGE -- WHICH WERE REPORTED EARLIER -- TO THE DETRIMENT OF A
LARGE NUMBER OF POOR FAMILIES.

   IT IS PUBLICLY EVIDENT THAT THE COMMUNISTS AND THEIR CLOSEST ALLIES WERE
BEHIND THE PREPARATION, COORDINATION AND EXECUTION OF THESE CRIMINALS
ACTIONS.

   UNFORTUNATELY, ONE CANNOT FAIL TO LINK THESE ACTIONS TO THE THREATENING,
VIOLENT SPEECHES -- FOLLOWING THE STYLE USED BY THE POPULAR UNITY MEMBERS --
WITH WHICH SOME LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION COALITION OPENED THE ELECTORAL
CAMPAIGN OF THEIR CANDIDATE PATRICIO AYLWIN.

   IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE TO REGARD THESE AGGRESSIONS AS SIGNALS AND WARNINGS
OF THE INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN SOME POLITICAL
UMBRELLA GROUPS.  THESE GROUPS CONSIST OF SECTORS ADVOCATING A PEACEFUL
DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE ON THE ONE HAND, AND OTHER SECTORS THAT FOLLOW THE
LINE OF THOSE WHO IN THE PAST DESTROYED OUR TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE ON THE
OTHER HAND.

   ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS STATED ITS DECISION NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, IT CANNOT FAIL TO ANNOUNCE ITS POSITION AND TO STATE
ITS OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF A MALICIOUS AND DEMAGOGICAL RHETORIC THAT POSES A
THREAT TO PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE GOVERNMENT YIELD TO THOSE WHO TIME AND
AGAIN SEEK AND PROMOTE SUBVERSION AND TO DISRUPT OUR DEMOCRATIC
INSTITUTIONAL ORDER. [END RECORDING]

   BOGOTA, 20 JUL 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THAT THE
ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION-CAMILIST UNION (UC-ELN) TODAY CARRIED OUT ITS
SIXTH ATTACK THIS YEAR AGAINST THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE, WHICH LINKS THE
COLOMBIAN TOWNS OF ORITO AND TUMACO NEAR THE COLOMBIAN-ECUADORAN BORDER.  

   THE REBELS USED EXPLOSIVES TO BLOW UP 1 METER OF PIPELINE. THIS IS THE
REBELS' 33D ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL NETWORK IN 1989.  THE
AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL SPILL BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE
ATTACK, NO OIL WAS BEING PUMPED THROUGH THE PIPELINE.

   A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UC-ELN CALLED THE CALI
MEDIA TO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

   THE UC-ELN IS ATTACKING COLOMBIA'S OIL PIPELINES AS A WAY TO PRESSURE THE
GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THE OIL INDUSTRY AND TO SIGN MORE FAVORABLE
CONTRACTS WITH MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANIES. THIS YEAR ALONE, THE UC-ELN
LAUNCHED 25 ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE, THE LONGEST IN
COLOMBIA. THE ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON- COVENAS PIPELINE HAVE CAUSED
APPROXIMATE $150 MILLION IN DAMAGE.

   IF THE SIX ATTACKS ON THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE AND THE TWO ON THE
DINA-SALGAR OIL PIPELINE ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, LOSSES AMOUNT TO
APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. THE DINA-SALGAR PIPELINE CARRIES CRUDE OIL FROM
THE OIL FIELDS IN TOLIMA TO THE REFINERY IN BARRANCABERMEJA.

COUNTER THE SUBVERSIVES' ACTION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 31 JUL 89 (EL MUNDO) -- [TEXT] "I DO NOT WANT TO
INTERFERE AT ALL.  THE JUDGE WILL PRONOUNCE THE VERDICT; MEANWHILE, I
WILL WAIT AND KEEP SILENT," MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY
BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID YESTERDAY REGARDING HIS BROTHER SHORTLY
AFTER ENDING SUNDAY'S [30 JULY] HOMILY AT THE CATHEDRAL.

   THE PRELATE WAS REFERRING TO THE ARREST OF SALOMON ENRIQUE ROSA CHAVEZ,
WHO WAS TURNED OVER TO THE FIRST CRIMINAL COURT BY THE NATIONAL POLICE AND
ACCUSED OF BELONGING TO THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY (ERP).  THE FIRST
CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ORDERED HIS TEMPORARY ARREST FOLLOWING A 72 - HOUR
PERIOD, AS ESTABLISHED BY LAW FOR CRIMES OF BEARING COUNTERFEIT DOCUMENTS
AND FOR BRIBERY; THESE CRIMES DO NOT REQUIRE A PRISON SENTENCE.

   THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID:  "I HAVE REMAINED SILENT OUT OF RESPECT FOR
THE LEGAL PROCESS, WHICH IS STILL UNDER WAY.  MY BROTHER IS STILL IN PRISON,
AND THAT IS WHY I PREFER TO WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO END," HE SAID.  THE
PRISONER WAS NOT RELEASED ON SATURDAY, BUT HE WILL BE RELASED ON MONDAY, 7
AUGUST.

   ASKED BY REPORTERS IF THE CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIS BROTHER WOULD HURT HIS
[MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ'S] IMAGE OR THAT OF THE CHURCH, HE SAID THAT THE CHURCH'S
DUTY TO THE COUNTRY IS DIFFICULT TO FULFILL BUT THAT THE CHURCH'S EFFORTS
MUST CONTINUE, BECAUSE THE HUGE NUMBER OF PARISHIONERS WHO COME TO THE
CATHEDRAL EVERY SUNDAY TO EASE THEIR PAINS CANNOT BE ABANDONED.

   "A SHEPHERD SHOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS FLOCK, AND, WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS,
WE WILL CALMLY DEAL WITH THEM, BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF OUR MISSION," HE SAID.

   THE PRELATE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SERIES OF CONTROVERSIES THAT
AROSE DURING THE WEEK, SUCH AS THE CHARGES AND THE COUNTERCHARGES.  HE SAID
THAT THE MOST SERIOUS THING IS THE "CASE OF MSGR ROMERO," WHOSE MEMORY
CONTINUES TO INSPIRE MANY AND IS A NIGHTMARE FOR THE MASTERMINDS AND
PERPETRATORS OF HIS ABOMINABLE ASSASSINATION.  

   THESE CHARGES WERE MADE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL BY FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE,
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION MEMBERS, AND WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL FIGURES.  ROSA
CHAVEZ REFERRED TO THE CHARGES FILED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL DR MAURICIO ERNESTO
COLORADO, WHO LAST WEEK ASKED THE FIRST TREASURY COURT JUDGE TO DRAW UP AN
INDICTMENT AGAINST JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY, AND A
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER.

   THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID:  "I GREATLY REGRET THE FACT THAT THIS
ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF -- I ACCUSE YOU, YOU ACCUSE ME, AND WE ACCUSE EACH
OTHER.  THAT IS NO WAY TO MAKE PROGRESS, BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT THEIR LEADERS
TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE AND SERIOUS.  OTHERWISE, WHAT WILL THOSE OF US WHO
ARE UNDERLINGS LEARN?  THAT IS WHY I HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR ALL OF US
TO HELP CLEAR THE AIR SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE PEACE FOR WHICH WE ALL
YEARN."

   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ CONGRATULATED ALL JOURNALISTS IN HIS HOMILY AND SAID:
"I REMIND ALL JOURNALISTS -- AS POPE JOHN PAUL II ONCE SAID -- THAT NEWS, IF
ONE THINKS ABOUT IT, IS NEVER IMPARTIAL, BECAUSE IT AT LEAST INTENTIONALLY
AND IMPLICITLY RESPONDS TO IMPORTANT MATTERS.  JOURNALISM PROVIDES AN
INTIMATE LINK BETWEEN THE NEWS, EDUCATION, AND ESSENTIAL VALUES.  ALMOST ALL
MEN AND WOMEN WORKING FOR THE PRESS, RADIO, AND TELEVISION MEDIA MUST TRY TO
ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK.  HOWEVER, EACH DAY THEY NEED COURAGE AND MUST HAVE
MUCH LOVE FOR THIS PEOPLE, WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY, SO THAT THEY WILL
REMAIN LOYAL TO THE VALUES OF THEIR PROFESSION.  THAT IS WHY OUR
CONGRATULATION MESSAGE BECOMES A PRAYER FOR THE LORD TO PROTECT THEM AND
HELP THEM NOT TO GIVE IN DURING DIFFICULT TIMES."

BE STRENGTHENED ARE VENEZUELA'S VISIBLE REACTIONS TO THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF
LIBERAL PARTY LEADER LUIS CARLOS GALAN.

   MEANWHILE, IT WAS LEARNED THAT EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, RECENTLY ARRESTED
IN COLOMBIA AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCES, WAS TRYING TO PURCHASE LAND IN VENEZUELA TO
EXPAND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION.

   ACCORDING TO PEREZ, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS COULD BE MOVED
TO VENEZUELAN TERRITORY.  THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT STRESSED THE NEED TO
ADOPT STRONG MEASURES AGAINST SUCH A POSSIBILITY.  "THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE
MUST UNITE IN THIS BATTLE," THE HEAD OF STATE SAID.  HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT
VENEZUELA WILL SUPPORT COLOMBIA BY STEPPING UP SURVEILLANCE ALONG THE BORDER.

   IN THIS SENSE, VENEZUELAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL FILMO LOPEZ UZCATEGUI
ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF "TASK FORCES" THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED ALONG
VENEZUELA'S WESTERN BORDER.  THESE TASK FORCES WILL CARRY OUT INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT THE MILITARY UNITS STATIONED IN THE AREA.

   THE MINISTER REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF PARAMILITARY PERSONNEL BEING
RECRUITED TO FORM THE "TASK FORCES" AND ADDED THAT INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONE
THAT OCCURRED IN EL AMPARO ON THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA LAST YEAR WHEN A
GROUP OF SOLDIERS MURDERED 17 FISHERMEN WILL NOT BE REPEATED.

   "WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY TO
CONTINUE THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, THE MINISTER SAID.

   ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY SOURCES STATIONED ALONG THE COLOMBIAN -
VENEZUELAN BORDER, AND CARRIED IN TODAY'S EDITION OF EL NACIONAL, MEDELLIN
CARTEL TREASURER MARTINEZ ROMERO WANTED TO BUY LAND IN ZULIA AND TACHIRA,
TWO VENEZUELAN STATES, TO EXPAND THE ORGANIZATION'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.

   BOGOTA, 28 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COMBINED ARMY AND POLICE FORCES HAVE
RAIDED AN OFFICE IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA THAT APPARENTLY SERVED AS THE "FINANCIAL
HEADQUARTERS" OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GROUP HEADED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ
GACHA, THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSS. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS
MADE TODAY BY THE COLOMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY.

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED THE NUMBERS OF THE
BANK ACCOUNTS THE DRUG TRAFFICKER HAS IN COLOMBIA AND ABROAD.  THE
AUTHORITIES CONFISCATED 30 SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERS, TELEFAX, AND OTHER
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER SEVERE SETBACK FOR RODRIGUEZ
GACHA, ONE OF THE MAFIA BOSSES MOST WANTED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS THE MEXICAN, IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE RIGHT-HAND
MAN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S TOP BOSS.  GACHA'S GROUP
HAS SUFFERED MANY LOSSES DUE TO THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT
AGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA. OVER THE
PAST FEW DAYS, ELITE ARMY TROOPS HAVE SEIZED SEVERAL LARGE FARMS OWNED BY
RODRIGUEZ GACHA IN THE TOWN OF PACHO, AS WELL AS LUXURIOUS RESIDENCES IN
BOGOTA. A SON OF RODRIGUEZ GACHA, FREDDY RODRIGUEZ CELADES, AND THE GROUP'S
"CHIEF OF FINANCES," FERNANDO GALEANO BERRIO--WHO IS WANTED BY THE U.S.
AUTHORITIES--ARE BEING HELD BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES.  

   HOWEVER, DESPITE THE "WAR" THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED ON THE DRUG
TRAFFICKING GANGS, A SUPERIOR COURT HAS REVOKED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF
ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, RODRIGUEZ GACHA, AND OTHER PERSONS LINKED TO MASSACRES
CARRIED OUT BY RIGHTIST MILITARY GROUPS BEING TRAINED BY ISRAELI, BRITISH,
U.S., AND WEST GERMAN MERCENARIES, ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   THE RULING WAS MADE KNOWN YESTERDAY. TODAY THE COUNTRY IS STILL AMAZED,
CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE MAFIA LEADERS
MASTERMINDED THE MASSACRES, AS REPORTED BY JUSTICE MARIA ELENA DIAZ, WHO WAS
SHOT TO DEATH LAST MONTH, EVIDENTLY AS A REPRISAL FOR HAVING STATED THIS
OPINION.

   THE ARREST WARRANT ALSO INCLUDED LUIS RUBIO ROJAS, A FORMER MAYOR OF THE
TOWN OF PUERTO BOYACA, AN OPERATIONS CENTER OF RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY
ELEMENTS, AND SEVERAL ARMY DETACHMENT ELEMENTS WHO REPORTEDLY PROMOTE
TERRORIST SQUADRONS.  

   IT HAS BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED THAT ARMED ULTRA-RIGHTIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN
TRAINED BY FOREIGN MERCENARIES, INCLUDING JAIR KLEIN, A FORMER ISRAELI ARMY
COLONEL WHO COMMANDED HIS COUNTRY'S ANTITERRORIST CORPS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

GALAN, THE LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO WAS GUNNED DOWN IN
BOGOTA ON 18 AUGUST, ACCORDING TO GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, CHIEF OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS).

   "THERE IS A PERSON OF ARAB ORIGIN, WHO APPARENTLY HAS BEEN LINKED CLOSELY
TO THE CRIME," MAZA MARQUEZ TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY AFTER MEETING WITH
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, WITH WHOM HE DISCUSSED THE
DRAFTING OF NEW SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

   THE SUSPECT, JUBIS HAZVUMB [SPELLING AS RECEIVED], WHO WAS ARRESTED ALONG

VERY MUCH INVOLVED," SAID MAZA, WHO IN LATE MAY WAS THE TARGET OF A DYNAMITE
ATTACK CARRIED OUT IN BOGOTA, IN WHICH HE WAS NOT WOUNDED.

   "WE HAVE RECEIVED ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONFIRM THAT FOREIGNERS PARTICIPATED
IN SENATOR GALAN'S ASSASSINATION," THE DAS CHIEF SAID.  HE ADDED THAT THE
INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO LOCATE THE PERPETRATORS HAVE SO
FAR BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

   "WE HAVE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN GALAN'S
MURDER AND THAT IT WAS WELL-PLANNED," MAZA SAID.  

   HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL RECEIVE, STARTING
TODAY, ADDITIONAL PERSONAL SECURITY PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

SOME STATEMENTS MADE EXCLUSIVELY TO MADRID RADIO BY A FORMER MEMBER OF
THE CHILEAN SECRET POLICE.  JOSE MANUEL MARTIN MEDEM REPORTS:

   [MARTIN MEDEM] THE EXILES FROM CHILE, ARGENTINA, AND URUGUAY REPEATEDLY
STATED THAT WHILE THERE WERE MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS IN THEIR COUNTRIES, THE
ARMED FORCES OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF LATIN AMERICA ACTED JOINTLLY, WITHOUT
RESPECTING BORDERS, IN REPRESSION.  IN THIS WAY, THEY WERE ABLE TO KIDNAP AN
EXILE FROM WHERE HE HAD TAKEN REFUGE AND MAKE HIM RETURN TO THE COUNTRY OF
ORIGIN, WHERE MANY WERE TORTURED AND MURDERED.  OUR COLLEAGUE, JAVIER
GONZALEZ, HAS NOW MANAGED A WITNESS REPORT THAT CONFIRMS THESE ACCUSATIONS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] A FORMER MEMBER OF DINA [NATIONAL
INTELLEGENCE DIRECTORATE], THE CHILEAN SECRET SERVICE UNDER PINOCHET,
HAS ASKED REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN SPAIN.  HE IS JUAN JOSE SOTO
VARGAS, WHO WORKED IN THE DINA CITIZENS' INTELLIGENCE BRIGADE.  HE HAS
TURNED AWAY FROM THE REGIME, ALTHOUGH HE MAINTAINED HIS IDEOLOGICAL
STANCE.  SOTO VARGAS, A DOCTOR BY PROFESSION AND A PASTOR OF AN
EVANGELICAL CHURCH, HAS MADE EXCLUSIVE STATEMENTS TO MADRID RADIO IN
WHICH HE CONFIRMS POLICE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REGION'S MILITARY
GOVERNMENTS DURING THE PERIOD OF STATE TERRORISM.

   [SOTO VARGAS] WE, IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY, WORKED WITH THE ARGENTINE
FEDERAL POLICE AND WITH THE ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST
SUBVERSION IN 1976 AND SHORTLY BEFORE ISABEL MARTINEZ DE PERON LEFT POWER.
WE ALSO WORKED JOINTLY WITH THE SECURITY FORCES OF URAGUAY, PARAGUAY, AND
BRAZIL.  I WORKED IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN BRAZIL WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE
NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE OF THE BRAZILIAN CENTRAL AGENCY.  WELL,
RELATIONS WERE THE BEST AND THIS WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SOUTH AMERICAN ARMED
FORCES, AT TO INSTALL ITSELF IN SOUTH AMERICA OR TO IMPOSE ITSELF THROUGH
GUERRILLA TACTICS AND VIOLENCE.

   [GONZALEZ] SOTO VARGAS HAS ALREADY REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHICH HE HAS HAD TO LEAVE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.  HE
SAYS THAT HE DID NOT TORTURE OR KILL ANYONE AND THAT THINGS LIKE THIS DID
NOT HAPPEN IN CHILE.  HOWEVER, HE ADMITS THAT GENERAL CARLOS PRATS, THE HEAD
OF THE ARMY UNDER PRESIDENT ALLENDE, WAS ASSASSINATED IN BUENOS AIRES UNDER
ORDERS OF THE PINOCHET GOVERNMENT.

   [SOTO VARGAS] THERE IS PROOF, EVEN JUDICIAL PROOF, THAT THERE WAS
PARTICIPATION BY HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE CHILEAN ARMY WHO WERE ORDERED
TO CARRY OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WORKED IN THE MILITARY
SECTION OF THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN ARGENTINA, GEN VICTOR HUGO BARRIERA
BARRIERA OF THE ARMY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AN THERE WAS TALK IN THE CHILEAN
EMBASSY THAT THE CHILEAN HIGH-RANKING OFFICER HAD ORDERED THE PHYSICAL
EXTERMINATION OF PRATS.  [AS HEARD] [END RECORDING]

   SAN SALVADOR, 29 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] RICALDONE INSTITUTE
DIRECTOR FATHER GIUSSEPPE CORO PROTESTED TODAY THE MURDER OF A YOUNG
MECHANICS STUDENT AND LATER ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE THE INSTITUTE IN
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS AT WAR.  THE RICALDONE
INSITUTE IS ONE OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT SCHOOLS RUN BY SALESIAN PRIESTS
IN EL SALVADOR.

   FATHER CORO STATED DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT STUDENT MIGUEL
ERNESTO MIRANDA REINA, 18, "WHO WAS THE BEST MECHANICS STUDENT IN THE
INSTITUTE,' WAS DESPICABLY AND COWARDLY SHOT IN THE BACK WHEN HE WAS
ABOUT TO APPROACH HIS HOUSE IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR ON 22 AUGUST.
FATHER CORO ACCUSED THE "ATLACATL" BATTALION SOLDIERS, PARTICULARLY AN
OFFICER, "A LIEUTENANT, SERGEANT, OR WHOMEVER," WHO LATER ATTEMPTED TO
DISTORT THE EVENT BY STATING THAT THE YOUNG STUDENT WAS A "REBEL"
BECAUSE HE WORE REBEL BOOTS AND HAD A REBEL BOOK.

   THE SALESIAN PRIEST, WHO HAS LIVED IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY
FOR THE PAST 16 YEARS, SAID THAT THE STUDENT WAS RETURNING HOME AFTER
WORKING ON HIS THESIS AS HE WAS TO GRADUATE THIS YEAR.  THE STUDENT
WORE THE SCHOOL'S UNIFORM, HAD HIS IDENTIFICATION PAPERS, AND CARRIED
A BOOK ON RELIGION THAT SHOWED JESUS CHRIST WITH A BEARD ON ITS COVER.

   FATHER CORO STATED THAT SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO KILL AN INNOCENT
YOUNG MAN WHO WAS AN HONOR STUDENT, THE SOLDIERS HAD STARTED TO KEEP A
WATCH ON THE INSTITUTE, TO STOP STUDENTS TO HARRASS THEM MENTALLY BY
ASKING THEM IF THEY KNEW MIRANDA REINA, TO PLACE A CHECKPOINT IN FRONT
OF THE MURDERED STUDENT'S HOME, AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES.  HE ADDED
THAT IF THESE MEASURES ARE NOT STOPPED, THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY IN EL
SALVADOR WILL PROTEST TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND.

   FATHER CORO STATED THAT THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY FEELS AFFECTED BY
THESE ACTIONS AS THEIR SCHOOLS HAVE ALWAYS EDUCATED THE YOUNG SO THAT
THEY CAN EARN A LIVILIHOOD AND THAT THESE MEASURES -- POSSIBLY ORDERED
BY MID-LEVEL COMMANDERS -- HINDER THEIR ACTIVITIES AND CAUSES
INSTABILITY IN THE STUDENT BODY THAT DOES NOT PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL
ADVANCEMENT.

ACTIVISTS ARE MISSING.

   "ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE CANNOT BE BLAMED ON A [WORDS INDISTINCT], BUT
THE INCREASE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS CLEARLY AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN."

   IN ADDITION TO THE COCAINE, WHICH THE DIPLOMATS SAY IS TAKEN TO THE
UNITED STATES ABOARD LIGHT PLANES OR IN AUTOMOBILES THROUGH MEXICO AND
TEXAS, U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE IN OPIUM PRODUCTION IN
GUATEMALA.  ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES, THE NUMBER OF HECTARES PLANTED
WENT FROM 225 IN 1985 TO 1,500 THIS YEAR.

   THERE ARE INSISTENT RUMORS THAT BANKER RAMIRO CASTILLO LOVE WAS
MURDERED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE ON 25 AUGUST BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO LAUNDER
DRUG MONEY.  THERE IS OPEN TALK IN THE CAPITAL ABOUT IMPORTANT
POLITICIANS BEING LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE DIPLOMATS SAY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK
SUCH SPECULATION AND THEY ADD THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SEVERAL
INTERESTS ARE WORKING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY'S FRAGILE DEMOCRACY.

   "IT SEEMS AS IF SEVERAL STRINGS ARE BEING PULLED AT THE SAME TIME,"
A DIPLOMAT SAID.

   WHILE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS GIVEN
GUATEMALA A RESPITE, AFTER DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES DURING WHICH IT
IS BELIEVED THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF
POLITICAL VIOLENCE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,200 LEFTIST
GUERRILLAS ARE STILL FIGHTING IN THE MOUNTAINS.

   FURTHERMORE, THE COUNTRY HAS FACED TWO COUP ATTEMPTS SINCE
DEMOCRACY WAS RESTORED IN 1986.

   THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING, WITH ITS TIES TO THE LAND-OWNING OLIGARCHY,
CONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE COUNTRY.  IT HAS BLOCKED A
MAJORITY OF REFORMS THAT CEREZO HAS TRIED TO INTRODUCE AND, ACCORDING
TO THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, IT HAS PROMOTED DISCONTENT AMONG THE ARMED
FORCES' MID-LEVEL OFFICERS.

   "THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING IS UNDOUBTEDLY BEHIND PART OF THE VIOLENCE,"
SAID A DIPLOMAT.  "IT COULD BE TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO
OVERREACT OR CAUSE THE ARMY TO GET INVOLVED."

   AS IF TO CONFIRM THIS, A POLICE ARREST WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED
AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIONEL SISNIEGA, A NOTED
POLITICIAN WHO LEANS TO THE RIGHT AND HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN COUP
ATTEMPTS SINCE 1954, ON CHARGES OF HEADING A GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR
MUCH OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY.

   DIPLOMATS HAVE ALSO POINTED TO THE RESURGENCE OF ACTIVITIES BY
LEFT-WING GUERRILLAS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO TOPPLE SUCCESSIVE
GOVERNMENTS OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES.

   "NOWADAYS THEY ARE USING MUCH MORE OBVIOUS TACTICS, ERECTING
BARRICADES ON HIGHWAYS AND OCCUPYING SMALL TOWNS NEAR THE CAPITAL,"
ONE DIPLOMAT SAID.

   FEAR THAT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SEVENTIES WILL RETURN MAY ALSO
CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A RESURGENCE IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
THAT CROSS OVER TO MEXICO.

   MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED CENTRAL
AMERICANS DEPORTED TO GUATEMALA HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

   THE DIPLOMATS FEEL THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT WILL WEATHER THE
VIOLENCE AND PASS IT ONTO HIS SUCCESSOR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 1990.

   "PERHAPS THE SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF THE PREPARATION FOR
ELECTIONS IN GUATEMALA," A DIPLOMAT SAID.  "THINGS WILL PROBABLY
WORSEN NEXT YEAR."

   GUATEMALA CITY, 27 SEP 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] IT WAS REPORTED IN
THIS CAPITAL TODAY THAT HEAVILY ARMED MEN KIDNAPPED THREE EUROPEANS IN
TECUN UMAN LAST NIGHT.

   THOSE WHO WERE KIDNAPPED ARE JOSE MARIA MARTINEZ, 55, FROM SPAIN;
ROBERTO LIZARDI, 52, FROM FRANCE; AND LUIS ROSSI, 35, FROM ITALY.

   THE REPORT ON THE KIDNAPPINGS WAS MADE BY EDGAR AND LESBIA LEAL,
OWNERS OF THE DON JOSE HOTEL LOCATED ON THE BORDER WITH MEXICO.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, THE HEAVILY ARMED AND UNIDENTIFIED
INDIVIDUALS BROKE INTO THE HOTEL LOBBY WHERE THE THREE EUROPEANS WERE
AND TOOK THEM AWAY TO AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION.

   THE HOTEL OWNERS SAID THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THE REASON FOR THE
TRIPLE KIDNAPPING OR THE IDENTITIES OF THE PERPETRATORS.

   BOGOTA, 1 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL LIBERATION
ARMY [ELN] GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, WHICH KIDNAPPED SPANISH BUSINESSMAN
PABLO MARTIN BERROCAL ALMOST 2 MONTHS AGO IN QUITO, IS DEMANDING 1
BILLION PESETAS RANSOM FOR HIS RELEASE.

   SOURCES CLOSE TO THE REBEL GROUP, THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS NOT JOINED
THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE PROCESS IN COLOMBIA, TOLD EFE THAT NEGOTIATIONS
FOR HIS RELEASE ARE BEING CARRIED OUT IN AN UNIDENTIFIED BORDER TOWN.

   COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, DISGUISED AS POLICEMEN, KIDNAPPED THE
55-YEAR-OLD BUSINESSMAN LAST 9 AUGUST AT THE HOTEL WHERE BERROCAL WAS
STAYING IN THE DOWNTOWN SECTION OF THE ECUADORAN CAPITAL.  THE SAME
SOURCES STATED THAT BERROCAL'S WIFE, BLANCA PARADELA, AND A PARTNER
ARE IN COLOMBIA NEGOTIATING FOR THE BUSINESSMAN'S RELEASE DIRECTLY
WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ELN, A REBEL GROUP LED BY FORMER SPANISH
PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ,

   THE ELN HAS NOT ANNOUNCED THE MOTIVE FOR THE KIDNAPPING.  SOURCES
CONSULTED WITH BY EFE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE COLOMBIAN
REBEL GROUP HAS ONLY ECONOMIC MOTIVES.

   BERROCAL OWNS A BULLFIGHTING RING IN QUITO AND HE PARTICIPATES WITH
HIS BROTHER, BULLFIGHTING BUSINESSMAN LUIS MARTIN BERROCAL, IN LA
SEPULVEDANA TRANSPORTATION COMPANY.

   NEITHER THE COLOMBIAN NATIONAL POLICE NOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS), CHARGED WITH THE COUNTRY'S SECRET
INVESTIGATIONS, HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON MARTIN BERROCAL OR HIS ALLEGED
PRESENCE IN THE COUNTRY.

   EFE HAS LEARNED THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF MARTIN BERROCAL, WHO WENT
TO BOGOTA IN MID-SEPTEMBER, DID NOT GET IN CONTACT WITH THE COLOMBIAN
AUTHORITIES WHEN THEY PASSED THROUGH THIS CITY.

   THE ELN, A MARXIST-LENINIST ORIENTED GROUP THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED
IN ARMED STRUGGLE FOR 25 YEARS, HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY ITS ATTACKS
ON THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE AND FREQUENT KIDNAPPINGS OF NEWSMEN
AND POLITICIANS OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE GROUP HAS BEEN ACTIVE ALONG THE COLOMBIAN BORDER, ESPECIALLY
AREAS THAT BORDER ECUADOR AND VENEZUELA.

ESTABLISHED UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY MEASURES TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF
THE GROUP OF EIGHT PRESIDENTS AND FOREIGN MINISTERS WHO WILL BEGIN
MEETING ON 9 OCTOBER IN TRUJILLO, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD-LARGEST CITY,
570 KM NORTH OF LIMA.

   ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, SOME 15,000 OFFICERS, INCLUDING POLICE,
ARMY, NAVY, AND AIR FORCE PERSONNEL, WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURITY
AT TRUJILLO AND ICA, 300 KM SOUTH OF LIMA.

   ARGENTINE PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY,
COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, URUGUAYAN PRESIDENT JULIO MARIA
SANGUINETTI, MEXICAN PRESIDENT CARLOS SALINAS, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL MEET AT
THE "LAS DUNAS" HOTEL IN ICA 11-12 OCTOBER.  HOTEL WORKERS AND
EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN REPLACED AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE.

   THE PRESIDENTS OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WILL ALSO BE MEETING
IN ICA ON 10 OCTOBER TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH
AFFECTS THEIR COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY.

   THIS MEETING WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR PARACAS, A TOWN NEAR ICA,
BUT WAS MOVED TO ICA FOR SECURITY REASONS.

   THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO BARRACKS THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY SINCE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO SOURCES, IT IS EXPECTED
THAT THE SHINING PATH AND THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
(MRTA) WILL TRY TO STAGE VIOLENT ACTS DURING THE MEETINGS.

   THE GUARDS AROUND THE EMBASSIES OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT COUNTRIES
HAVE BEEN REINFORCED WITH POLICE DOGS TRAINED TO DETECT EXPLOSIVES.

   POLICE HAVE ALSO ARRESTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN LIMA TO CHECK ON
ANY POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS TO GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS OR TO SEE IF THEY HAVE
ACCOUNTS TO SETTLE WITH THE COURTS.

   THE ROUNDUPS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT TO FIND LOCAL TELEVISION
MAGNATE HECTOR DELGADO PARKER, WHO WAS APPARENTLY KIDNAPPED BY THE
MRTA DURING AN INCIDENT IN WHICH DELGADO'S DRIVER WAS KILLED AND HIS
BODYGUARD WOUNDED.

   THE KIDNAPPING WAS CARRIED OUT BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE, TWO OF WHOM
WERE DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORMS, IN THE STREETS OF LIMA ON 4 OCTOBER.

   NEWSPAPER SOURCES TODAY SAID THAT AN ALLEGED LIEUTENANT TO MRTA
CHIEF VICTOR POLAY, WHO HAS BEEN IN PRISON SINCE DECEMBER 1988, HAS

THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, AND PERU BEGAN
DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUSTING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT
AND EVENTUALLY ACCEPTING ECUADOR IN ITS PLACE.  THE POSSIBILITY OF
EXPELLING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP WAS DISCUSSED EVEN THOUGH ARGENTINE
FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO SAID THE ISSUE WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OUSTING OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT
AND REPLACING IT WITH ECUADOR, ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO
CAVALLO TOLD EFE: "WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO THE PROPOSAL, BUT WE
PREFER NOT TO COMMENT FOR THE TIME BEING.  WE WILL SEE WITHIN THE
CONTEXT OF THE MEETING WHAT THE BASIS FOR THAT PROPOSAL IS."

   CAVALLO ADDED: "WE DO NOT HAVE PROPOSALS OR INITIATIVES ANY
DIFFERENT FROM THE ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED ON PANAMA."

   MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTER FERNANDO SOLANA TOLD EFE THAT THE
PREPARATORY FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING WILL DISCUSS THE PANAMANIAN
ISSUE AND THAT MEXICO WILL DECIDE ITS STANCE "AT THE APPROPRIATE
TIME."

   BRAZILIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ROBERTO DE ABREU SAID IN THIS CITY
YESTERDAY THAT BRAZIL HAS AN INDIVIDUAL POSITION "BUT WILL ACCEPT AND
SUPPORT A JOINT AGREEMENT."

   PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX ALSO SAID YESTERDAY
THAT PERU WILL PROPOSE "THE FINAL SEPARATION OF PANAMA" FROM THE GROUP
OF EIGHT.

   LARCO ADDED THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL PROPOSE THE SEPARATION
OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP DURING THE SUMMIT MEETING THAT WILL BE HELD
WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, URUGUAY,
AND VENEZUELA ON 11 AND 12 OCTOBER.  THE MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE IN
ICA, 850 KM SOUTH OF TRUJILLO.

   TODAY LARCO COX OPENED THE GROUP OF EIGHT FOREIGN MINISTERS'
MEETING IN TRUJILLO.  THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA
WERE ABSENT BECAUSE THEY WILL GO DIRECTLY TO ICA WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE
PRESIDENTS.

   IN A BRIEF SPEECH, LARCO COX CALLED ON THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES TO
STRUGGLE FOR THE UNITY, INTEGRATION, AND INDEPENDENCE IN THE REGION.

   COX ADDED: "WE MUST WORK FOR OVERALL DEVELOPMENT. WE PROPOSE AS AN
ACT OF JUSTICE THE INTEGRATION OF THE CONTINENT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE."

   HE ADDED THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS CANNOT BE AN ISOLATED PROCESS
AND THAT UNITY CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF THE COUNTRIES RESCUE THE
HISTORIC VALUES WHICH CONSOLIDATED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE AMERICAS.

   THE MINISTERS ALSO DISCUSSED, IN ADDITION TO THE PANAMANIAN AND
ECUADORAN CASE, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM, JOINT ACTION TO DEAL
WITH THE REGION'S FOREIGN DEBT, ESTIMATED AT $420 BILLION, AND
TERRORISM.

   THE PROPOSALS MADE IN TRUJILLO WILL BE DISCUSSED BY THE SEVEN
PRESIDENTS IN ICA.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING IS BEING HELD UNDER POLICE AND
 MILITARY CONTROL TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. ON 4 OCTOBER A CAR
BOMB EXPLODED ABOUT 500 METERS FROM THE MEETING SITE.  FORTUNATELY,
THERE WAS ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE.

   SOME OF THE SECURITY MEASURES INCLUDED THE CHANGE OF THE FOREIGN
MINISTERS' ARRIVAL TIMES AND SOME CHANGES IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM.

   THERE IS STRICT POLICE CONTROL NEAR THE CESAR VALLEJO CIVIC CENTER
WHERE THE MINISTERS ARE MEETING.  VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC WAS
PROHIBITED WITHIN ABOUT 200 METERS OF THE CENTER.

   THE FIRST MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT WAS HELD IN ACAPULCO,
MEXICO, IN 1987, AND THE SECOND MEETING WAS HELD IN PUNTA DEL ESTE,
URUGUAY, IN 1988.

AS THE NEW FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPLACE MARIO PALENCIA.  CEREZO ALSO
APPOINTED NEW GOVERNMENT AND FINANCE MINISTERS, GENERAL CARLOS AUGUSTO
MORALES AND FRANCISCO PINTO CASAROLA, RESPECTIVELY, TO REPLACE ROBERTO

   SAN SALVADOR, 10 OCT 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] SEVERAL
SALVADORAN SECTORS HAVE CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF THE WIFE OF THE DEPUTY
EDITOR OF EL DIARIO DE HOY.  SHE WAS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS NEAR THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY THIS MORNING.  SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS DESCRIBED THE ACTION AS TERRORIST.  HE SAID THIS
IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH WILL SURELY ALSO BE
CONDEMNED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PASTOR
RIBREJO, WHO IS IN THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE LAST STRAW IS THAT TERRORISTS,
WITHOUT ANY RISK TO THEMSELVES, KILL DEFENSELESS WOMEN.  THIS
PARTICULAR LADY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM WAS
WOUNDED.  WE THINK THIS IS THE LIMIT.  WE ARE NOT SURE WHO DID IT,
BUT, CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THE ACTION, IT APPEARS TO BE A
TERRORIST CRIME.  WE ALREADY KNOW WHO PERPETRATES SUCH ACTIONS.  WE
THINK THIS IS PART OF WHAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] HAS BEEN DOING.  THEY HAVE BEEN SILENCING VOICES
THAT UPHOLD PHILOSOPHIES THAT RUN CONTRARY TO THEIR'S.  [END
RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE PRESENCE OF PASTOR RIBREJO IN THE COUNTRY,
CRISTIANI SAID THE UN OFFICIAL WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE POLICY
OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES DOES NOT FIT THE
VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I WILL NOT REFER TO MONSIGNOR ARTURO
RIVERA Y DAMAS ALONE, BUT TO ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LINKED TO THE
FMLN THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT.  I THINK DR
RIBREJO WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE
ARMED FORCES ARE IN THE HABIT OF VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS.  I THINK IF
ONE TRIES TO BE OBJECTIVE AND REALISTIC, HE WILL REALIZE THAT THE FMLN
HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THE HOMELAND FALL INTO A STATE OF TOTAL
ANARCHY. I THINK THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACTED VERY PROFESSIONALLY.  THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRY TO SEEK SOLUTIONS THROUGH REASON
RATHER THAN VIOLENCE.  THESE EVENTS MUST BE SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT
THE FMLN SAID IT WOULD DO.  IT SAID IT WOULD UNLEASH EVEN GREATER
VIOLENCE. [END RECORDING]

   AS FOR THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER, CRISTIANI SAID A COMMISSION IS READY TO RESUME TALKS
WITH THE FMLN, TO WHICH A CEASE-FIRE WILL BE PROPOSED, AMONG OTHER
THINGS. CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED
WORKING ON THE LOGISTICS OF THE MEETING SO THE TALKS CAN BE HELD IN
PEACE.

PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS STATED THAT HE IS "PROUD AND HONORED" OVER
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SEVER RELATIONS
WITH HIS GOVERNMENT, AND DESCRIBED THE SALVADORAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE AS A
"MURDERER."

   IN A SPEECH IN THE TOWN OF SOMOTILLO, ON THE BORDER WITH HONDURAS,
ORTEGA SAID THAT THE NEWS OF HIS SALVADORAN COLLEAGUE'S ANNOUNCEMENT
"FILLED ME WITH JOY BECAUSE WE WILL THUS AVOID RECEIVING THE PRESIDENT
OF A GOVERNMENT THAT MURDERS PRIESTS, NUNS, AND POLITICAL LEADERS."

   THE NICARAGUAN CAPITAL HAS BEEN SET AS THE SITE FOR THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR 8-9 DECEMBER.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE WILL ASK THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR "UNTIL THE SLAYERS OF
THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS MURDERED IN EL SALVADOR ARE PUNISHED."  THE
PRIESTS WERE MURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER.

INVOLVING [WORDS INDISTINCT] WORKERS, WHICH IN THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS
CAUSED STREET VIOLENCE IN LIMA, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF
CONCERN FOR THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.

   THE STRIKE, WHICH WAS DECREED BY THE INTERSECTORIAL CONFEDERATION
OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES (CITE), IS BEING OBSERVED BY 300,000 PUBLIC
SERVANTS, WHO MAKE UP 50 PERCENT OF CITE MEMBERS. THE STRIKERS DEMAND
SALARY IMPROVEMENTS, THE REINSTATEMENT OF 250 DISMISSED WORKERS, AND
THE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE CITE.

   RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) SECRETARY
GENERAL LUIZ ALVA CASTRO, WHO IS ALSO THE APRA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,
REPORTED THAT TODAY HE MET WITH PRIME MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX IN
SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.

   ALVA SAID THAT "THERE IS GOOD WILL" TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT, WHICH HAS AFFECTED LARGE SECTORS OF THE POPULATION, WHO MAKE
USE OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, JUSTICE, TRANSPORTATION, AND COMMUNICATION
SERVICES. THE STRIKE HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE STATE, WHICH HAS FAILED TO
COLLECT 70 PERCENT OF TAXES BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE BY THE TAX
COLLECTORS.

   ALVA CASTRO SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD HIM THAT THERE WILL
BE NO PROBLEM IN RECOGNIZING THE CITE, PROVIDED THAT THIS ORGANIZATION
MEETS THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

   THERE WERE INCIDENTS IN LIMA ON 23 NOVEMBER, WHEN GROUPS OF CITE
MEMBERS DEMONSTRATED IN DOWNTOWN LIMA AND WERE REPRESSED BY THE
POLICE. DURING THE INCIDENTS, BOMBS WERE DETONATED, TIRES WERE BURNED,
AND THE POLICE SHOT IN THE AIR. AT LEAST [9] PERSONS DIED DURING THE
INCIDENTS LAST WEEK.

   A UNION SOURCE TODAY SAID THAT A 15-DAY STRIKE BY 3,500 WORKERS OF
THE STATE-RUN MINERO PERU COMPANY HAS CAUSED DAILY LOSSES OF $800,000.

   ACCORDING TO THE LABOR MINISTRY, THE STRIKES HAVE COST THE PRIVATE
SECTOR 13 MILLION HOURS OF LABOR,

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE MINING SECTOR LOST $80 MILLION DURING
18 DAYS OF STRIKE IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, WHILE THE FISHING SECTOR
HAS LOST $150 MILLION BECAUSE OF A STRIKE THAT THE WORKERS OF THE
SECTOR BEGAN 55 DAYS AGO.

   MOSCOW (USSR), 27 NOV 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [TEXT] THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS REJETED THE PROPOSAL FOR AN IMMEDIATE
CEASE-FIRE THAT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN],
ACCORDING TO MAURICIO SANDOVAL, SALVADORAN MINISTER OF CULTURE AND
COMMUNICATIONS.  SANDOVAL WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE U.S.  NEWS AGENCY
UPI.

   THE SALVADORAN PATRIOTS MADE THIS PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THE OAS
RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.  THE RECOMMENDATION
CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS.  BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA
CHAVEZ OFFERED HIS GOOD OFFICES.  VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES
PEREZ HAS ALSO JOINED THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP THE
VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR.  ON TUESDAY, 21 NOVEMBER, PEREZ MET WITH
OFFICIALS OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, NAMELY JUSTICE MINISTER
OSCAR SANTAMARIA AND MINISTER OF PRESIDENCY JUAN PADELA.

   ACCORDING TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, HE ALSO TALKED WITH HIS
SALVADORAN COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE PHONE.  IN THE COURSE
OF THIS TALK HE OFFERED TO HOST A CARACAS MEETING BETWEEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS.

   IT WOULD SEEM THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF CRISTIANI'S
ADMINISTRATION, ALL THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT YIELDED THE EXPECTED
FRUITS.  THE FACT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO
WORSEN THE TERROR.  WITH THIS IN MIND, THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A
LAW TO PUNISH THE OPPOSITION.  AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, CONGRESS HAS
ALREADY APPROVED ANTITERRORIST BILLS.  THESE BILLS ALLOW THE ARREST OF
PEOPLE ON SUSPICION OF ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.

   A SALVADORAN DEPUTY HAS LABELED THESE BILLS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND
CONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS.  MEANWHILE, THESE BILLS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE
ACURSED DEATH SQUADS.  AMERICAS WATCH, A HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION,
HAS REPORTED AN INCREASE OF [WORD INDISTINCT], ARRESTS OF AND THREATS
AGAINST FOREIGNERS WHO WORK FOR RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN
ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR.

   THE SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE CRUSADE
AGAINST FOREIGN MISSIONARIES IS ENCOURAGED BY THE ULTRARIGHTISTS WHO
ARE OPERATING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT
GUARANTEES THE REACTIONARIES THEIR IMPUNITY.

   DEATH SQUADS, WORKING CLOSELY WITH REACTIONARY MILITARY MEN AND THE
CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, ARE MOST CERTAINLY TO BLAME FOR THE RECENT
DISGRACEFUL MURDER OF SIX PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO THE
U.S. PUBLICATION THE BOSTON GLOBE.  THE PAPER STATES THAT THIS IS
OBVIOUS TO ALL AND THAT THE SALVADORAN REGIME AND THE YANKEE
GOVERNMENT ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT REFUSE TO ADMIT IT.

   FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THIS ATTITUDE IS REASONABLE.  WASHINGTON'S
POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR IS BASED ON THE ULTRARIGTHWING FORCES [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE BOSTON GLOBE ADDS THAT EVERY YEAR THE TAXPAYERS TAKE
OUT OF THEIR POCKETS $500 MILLION TO FINANCE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT GIVES TO EL SALVADOR.  SOME OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE
DEATH SQUADS WHICH ARE GUILTY OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITED AMID
HELLISH TORTURES.  IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF INFORMATION.

   THE THING IS THAT U.S. OFFICIALS PREFER TO LASH OUT AT THE
FICTITIOUS SHIPMENTS OF SOVIET WEAPONS TO EL SALVADOR, FICTITIOUS
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN NONE AT ALL.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USE THAT
SUCCESSIVE SALVADORAN REGIMES HAVE MADE OF U.S. AID, HAS ALWAYS BEEN
DOWNPLAYED.  HOWEVER, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WITHOUT THE HEFTY U.S.
SUBSIDIES, THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED A LONG
TIME AGO AND THE NEARLY 100,000 SALVADORANS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE
STRUGGLE, WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.  


DEV-MUC3-0888 (GTE)

   MOSCOW (USSR), 22 NOV 89 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES, IN
THE PAST FEW DAYS MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN EL SALVADOR
AFTER THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE FIGHT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND
THE GUERRILLAS.  MIKHAIL MAYOROV FILED THIS REPORT:

   THE HORRIFYING REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES GIVE AN
APPROPRIATE IDEA OF THE TRAGEDY IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE A CIVIL WAR IS
RAVAGING THE COUNTRY.  ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE
FIGHT IS BEING WAGED, THE PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO BURN DEAD BODIES RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSES.

   THE VICTIMS ARE NOT ONLY SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS, WHO ARE DIRECTLY
INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT, BUT ALSO CIVILIANS, WHOSE HOUSES ARE HIT BY
BOMBS AND PROJECTILES.  THE CIVILIANS ARE CONSTANTLY THREATENED BY THE
BULLIES OF THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS, WHO MURDERED SIX CATHOLIC
PRIESTS AT THE SAN SALVADOR UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.

   THE SALVADORAN SITUATION, WHICH HAS CAUSED SERIOUS CONCERN, CANNOT
BE REGARDED AS SOMETHING WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE WORLD NOW SEEMS TO BE
STRONGER THAN EVER.  WE HAVE FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE OLD
SAYING THAT THERE IS NO ISOLATED TRAGEDY.  WE FEEL INCREASINGLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SO-CALLED HOT SPOTS OF THE
PLANET.

   OBVIOUSLY, THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION IS
TO STEM THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT FLOW OF MILITARY SUPPLIES TO BOTH
SIDES.

   MOSCOW HAS ALREADY TAKEN THIS POSITION.  HOWEVER, U.S. PRESIDENT
GEORGE BUSH HAS TERMED INADMISSIBLE THE POSSIBILITY OF HALTING THE AID
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   IF WE COMPARE THE SALVADORAN AND THE AFGHAN SITUATIONS, WHY DOES
THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION SO BITTERLY REPPROACHED US FOR HELPING THE
NAJIBULLAH REGIME?

   WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY NOT YET ADOPTED GENERAL CRITERIA.

   OUR FOREIGN POLICY IS CONSISTENT, MAYOROV SAYS. IN MY OPINION,
SOVIET DIPLOMACY HAS A MORE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CURRENT
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT HAS ABANDONED ITS
CONSERVATIVE STAND, WHICH MADE US SUPPORT JUST ONE SIDE.  IN THE FINAL
ANALYSIS, THE WAR IS A TRAGEDY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE, AND THE MAGNITUDE
OF THE TRAGEDY GROWS AS THE CONFLICT BECOMES MORE SERIOUS.

   THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WILL REFLECT THE WILLINGNESS THAT MOSCOW
AND WASHINGTON HAVE TO HELP A SMALL NATION, WHICH IS TIRED OF A 
LONG-STANDING CONFLICT, FIND A WAY TOWARDS PEACE.

   ALL OF US ARE WAITING FOR THE SOVIET-U.S. SUMMIT WHICH WILL BE HELD
OFF THE COAST OF MALTA.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE ISSUES THAT
WILL BE ON THE AGENDA BECAUSE THE MEETING WILL BE UNOFFICIAL [AS
HEARD].

   THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT MAY BE ADDRESSED IN A BILATERAL SUMMIT.
IT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH SIDES REACH AN
UNDERSTANDING AND THAT THEY IDENTIFY THE POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION
FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PROBLEM.

   BOGOTA, 30 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 2) -- [TEXT] LAST
NIGHT'S TERRORIST TARGET WAS THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT. FOUR
POWERFUL ROCKETS WERE GOING TO EXPLODE VERY CLOSE TO THE TANKS WHERE
300,000 GALLONS OF THE SO-CALLED CASTILLE CRUDE, USED TO OPERATE THE
BOILERS, IS STORED. THE WATCHMEN ON DUTY REPORTED THAT AT 2030 THEY
SAW A MAN AND A WOMAN LEAVING A SMALL SUITCASE NEAR THE FENCE THAT
SURROUNDS THE PLANT. THE WATCHMEN EXCHANGED FIRE WITH THE TERRORISTS
WHO FLED LEAVING BEHIND THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL THAT ALSO INCLUDED
DYNAMITE AND GRENADE ROCKET LAUNCHERS. METROPOLITAN POLICE PERSONNEL
SPECIALIZING IN EXPLOSIVES, DEFUSED THE ROCKETS. SOME 100 PEOPLE WERE
WORKING INSIDE THE PLANT.

   THE DAMAGE THE ROCKETS WOULD HAVE CAUSED HAD THEY BEEN ACTIVATED
CANNOT BE ESTIMATED BECAUSE THE CARIBE SODA FACTORY AND THE GUAYABAL
RESIDENTIAL AREA WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN AFFECTED.

   THE ANTIOQUIA LIQUEUR PLANT HAS RECEIVED THREATS IN THE PAST AND
MAXIMUM SECURITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRACTICED IN THE AREA. SECURITY WAS
STEPPED UP LAST NIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE LIQUEUR INDUSTRY IS THE
LARGEST FOREIGN EXCHANGE PRODUCER FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTRY FLATLY DENIED CHARGES RAISED YESTERDAY BY AN ALLEGED
"JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND" THAT BLAMES CERTAIN OFFICERS OF THE ARMED
FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CATEGORICALLY
REJECTED "ALL TYPES OF SLANDER AND CHARGES AGAINST ITS MEMBERS,"
REFERRING TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED DOCUMENT THAT IT SAID "LACKS ALL LOGIC
AND CREDIBILITY."

   THE OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE POINTED OUT THAT "IN THESE MOMENTS, THE
ARMED FORCES ARE UNITED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE DEFENSE OF THE
FATHERLAND," ADDING THAT THE DOCUMENT ANONYMOUSLY DISTRIBUTED
YESTERDAY TO THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS IS "GREY PROPAGANDA."

   IN THE FOUR-PAGE DOCUMENT, A SO-CALLED "JUNIOR OFFICERS' COMMAND"
STATES THAT "COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, CHIEF OF THE TREASURY
POLICE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE (JESUITS') MURDERS."

   THE AUTHORS OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADD THAT THE "TROOPS FROM THAT
SECURITY CORPS LED BY CAPTAIN ALONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA" CARRIED OUT THE
EXECUTIONS," BUT IT DID NOT PROVIDE ANY DETAILS TO BACK UP THE
ACCUSATIONS.

   THE SIX JESUITS AND TWO MORE PERSONS WERE KILLED ON 16 NOVEMBER,
SHOT DURING THE NIGHT BY A GROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES OF THE CRIME.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION, INVITING
FOREIGN EXPERTS TO PARTICIPATE.

   THE OFFICIAL DEFENSE MINISTRY NOTE WARNED THAT "THE FORCE THAT
MAINTAINS THIS SOLID UNITY (OF THE ARMED FORCES) IS THE BLOOD SHED BY
OUR SOLDIERS TO DEFEND THE FATHERLAND AND OUR IDEAS, CUSTOMS,
RELIGION, DEMOCRACY, AND FREEDOM."

   THE MINISTRY'S COMMUNIQUE URGES THE CITIZENS "NOT TO ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO BE DECEIVED BY THE AMOUNT OF RUMORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
PRESSURES THAT THE MARXIST BOOKS OF THEORY CLEARLY DEFINE AS A FORM OF
STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE POWER."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO DISCLOSES THAT FORMER CAPTAIN MAURICIO MENA
SANDOVAL, WHO JOINED THE GUERRILLAS IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES, HAS MADE
TELEPHONE CALLS OR SENT "PERSONAL NOTES" TO CHIEFS OR OFFICERS.

   "THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS RESORT TO THIS TYPE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
TACTICS WHEN THEY FEEL THEY ARE LOST OR DESPERATE," THE COMMUNIQUE
ADDS, REFERRING TO THE FAILURE OF THE OFFENSIVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS
LAUNCHED ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 16 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] PANAMA'S
ARCHBISHOP MARCOS MCGRATH, PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE PRESIDENT
JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, AND PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES, PRESIDENT OF THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL (CSUCA), HAVE CONDEMNED THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS IN EL SALVADOR AT DAWN TODAY.

   MCGRATH, WHO DESCRIBED THE MULTIPLE ASSASSINATION AS "MONSTROUS,"
POINTED OUT THAT "IT IS EVERYBODY'S DUTY, ESPECIALLY OF THAT COUNTRY'S
GOVERNMENT, TO IDENTIFY, ARREST, AND TRY THE CULPRITS AND THOSE WHO
ORDERED THE ACTION."

   THIS "MUST NOT ONLY BE A JUST TRIAL OF THEM, BUT ALSO A MEANS TO
ELOQUENTLY EXPRESS THE REJECTION OF THE ENTIRE SOCIETY, WHICH CALLS
ITSELF CHRISTIAN, AGAINST SUCH A CRUEL AND UNJUST CRIME THAT REVEALS
ABSOLUTE CONTEMPT FOR HUMAN LIFE," A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ARCHBISHOP
MCGRATH STATES.

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES FROM EL SALVADOR'S JESUIT CURIA, THE SPANISH
JESUIT IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RECTOR OF EL SALVADOR'S CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY (UCA), FIVE OTHER PRIESTS, AND TWO SALVADORAN WOMEN WERE
MURDERED AT DAWN TODAY BY MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.

   IN THE OPINION OF SPANISH BISHOP JOSE LUIS LACUNZA, SECRETARY OF
PANAMA'S EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE AND RECTOR OF SANTA MARIA LA ANTIGUA
UNIVERSITY, "THESE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED WITH MALICE AND IN
COLD BLOOD."  "THEY ARE CERTAINLY TO BE CONDEMNED, REGARDLESS OF WHO
CARRIED THEM OUT," HE ADDED.

   CSUCA PRESIDENT PANAMANIAN ABDIEL ADAMES DESCRIBED AS "ABOMINABLE"
AND "REPREHENSIBLE" THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ADAMES, WHO IS ALSO RECTOR OF PANAMA'S NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,
REJECTED THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE "AS A MEANS TO REACH AGREEMENTS IN
EL SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED."

   CSUCA WILL ASK THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO DECLARE UCA A
"SANCTUARY" OR "NEUTRAL ZONE" TO TREAT THOSE WOUNDED IN THE CLASHES
BETWEEN THE ARMY AND GUERRILLAS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE 11
NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER TOWNS, ADAMES POINTED OUT.

   CSUCA COORDINATOR AND SALVADORAN GUILLERMO GALVAN SAID TODAY IN SAN
JOSE (COSTA RICA) THAT HE ASKED PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TO "MEDIATE TO
BRING ABOUT A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND STEP UP EFFORTS
TO PREVENT "MASSACRES" AND "SELECTIVE MURDERS."

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA
BY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [AMAT] MR.
PRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS
EXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN
GENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS
LLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU?

   [GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO
EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER
ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS
CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE
PRESIDENCY?

   [GARCIA] WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE.

   [AMAT] WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE
SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.  HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY
HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND
DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE
OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS
ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.
FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE
PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF
TRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT
FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU
THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND
ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO
EDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.

   [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL
PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS
HIM.

   [GARCIA] BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE
ME AS PRESIDENT.  [LAUGHTER]

   [AMAT] EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE?

   [GARCIA] I DID NOT SAY SO.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I NEVER FALL TO THE
LEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES.  I MAKE AN
OUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE.

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THIS DIALOGUE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE
AND OUR COUNTRY, [WORDS INDISTINCT], HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE
SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION
THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED,
MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED
STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOT
ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL
TACKLE IT.  THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO
BOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE
CONTINENT.  AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS.  LET COLOMBIANS HAVE
CONFIDENCE.

   SAN SALVADOR, 26 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MILTON GRIMALDI] [TEXT]
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT DESPITE THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST
SALVADORANS, HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE REBELS.
HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A
COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING
WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE
THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL
ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK
THIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE
FMLN:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT
WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN
COMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS
ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE,
INVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE
HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS ACTION.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE
COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH
ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION.
THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR
PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK
AND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS
FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.

   WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE
WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL
ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE
COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION
IS FULLY FORMED.

   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS
COMMISSION?

   [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE
REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION
AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE
CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS
TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD
THIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO
PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE
POLITICAL COMMISSION.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE
ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?

   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR
INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE
OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE
HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF
GOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER
WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT
OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC
FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN
VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE
LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. [END RECORDING]

   CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO
HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT
THE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP
MURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.

FIVE VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AT THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS
BEEN BLAMED, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, ON COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND
DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA.

   VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ BLAMED COLOMBIAN DRUG
TRAFFICKING GANGS FOR THE ATTACK -- IN WHICH FIVE GUARDS WERE KILLED
-- PERPETRATED ON 26 OCTOBER IN THE BORDER STATE OF APURE AGAINST A
NATIONAL GUARD PATROL IN THE AREA.

   REFERRING LAST NIGHT TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS, PEREZ SAID THIS
IS "A PROVOCATION FOR VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO EXTEND
THEIR CLAWS TO OUR COUNTRY."

   HOWEVER, JORGE ROMERO, GOVERNOR OF THE BORDER STATE OF TACHIRA,
WHICH BORDERS THE STATE OF APURE, MAINTAINED THIS WAS AN "ATTACK WITH
VERY POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES" PERPETRATED BY "MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIAN
GUERRILLAS, PRESUMABLY FROM THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY,
AGAINST A NATIONAL GUARD JEEP."

   ACCORDING TO ROMERO, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED DURING THE PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE EXPLOSIVES THAT KILLED THE FIVE SOLDIERS WERE
BURIED IN A ROAD NEAR CUTUFI, AND SET OFF BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE
MILITARY VEHICLE PASSED BY.

   LAST NIGHT, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY ORDERED THE ARREST OF FIVE ALLEGED
COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS, WHOM IT BLAMED FOR THE ATTACK.  HOWEVER, THE
ATTACKERS REPORTEDLY CROSSED THE BORDER INTO COLOMBIA.

INFORMATION.

   [STUDIO REPORTER] CAN YOU CONFIRM THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE'S BOMB
SQUAD?  AUTHORITIES FEAR THE CRASH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN
EXPLOSION RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT INSIDE THE AIRPLANE.

   [REPORTER] THE F-2 JUDICIAL POLICE AND CRIMINAL STATISTICS EXPERTS
ARE HERE.  THEY FEEL THAT THE ACCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A
TERRORIST ACTION.  THE REMARK WAS MADE BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS.
THEY NOTED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK BECAUSE
AIRPLANES DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF ACCIDENT UNLESS THERE IS AN
EXPLOSION, SOMETHING THAT HAS VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.  ACCORDING TO
REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL POLICE F-2 EXPERTS, THE AIRPLANE BROKE INTO
SIX PIECES.  IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, WHICH IS WHY THE 106
PASSENGERS ABOARD ARE STREWN ACROSS AN AREA 6-8 KM WIDE.

   ACCESS TO THE AIRPLANE'S REMAINS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS A
MOUNTAINOUS REGION.  THE CASQUITO [WORD INDISTINCT] IS THROUGH THE
ROAD THAT GOES FROM BOSA, CUNDINAMARCA DEPARTMENT, TO THE SCHOOL [NOT
FURTHER IDENTIFIED].  AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS AREA IS LOCATED VERY
CLOSE TO SLUICE NUMBER 3, MUNA 3, WHICH FEEDS WATER TO THE DAM.  THE
SITUATION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DRAMATIC.  RIGHT NOW, EXPERTS ARE
COLLECTING SAMPLES AND TRYING FIND ALL THEY CAN TO LEARN FOR SURE IF
THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACTION OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT CAUSED BY A FLAW IN
THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF THE HK-1803 AIRPLANE.

   APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE LEFT THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY WERE LOCKED
FOR 5 HOURS FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS AND
SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES
OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES (FECMAFAM) OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND
MURDERED AND MISSING PEOPLE.

   THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICIALS STILL REMAIN ON THE
THIRD FLOOR OF THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF RIOT
POLICEMEN EXPERT IN ANTITERRORIST STRUGGLE, ARMED WITH HIGH-CALIBER
RIFLES.

   RED CROSS, GREEN CROSS, AND RELIEF COMMAND MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN
THE EVACUATION OF THE OFFICES IN THE BUILDING.

   COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN
NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED WITHIN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS, BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES RULED OUT THE USE OF FORCE.

   MAURICIO SANDOVAL, DIRECTOR OF THE PRESIDENCY'S COMMUNICATIONS
SECRETARIAT, WENT TO "LA CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING, LOCATED IN EL
SALVADOR'S BUSINESS DISTRICT, TO LEARN ABOUT THE SITUATION AND
DESCRIBED THE OCCUPATION AS A "PROPAGANDA ACT" IN VIEW OF THE FACT
THAT THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND
THE GUERRILLAS, SCHEDULED FOR 16 AND 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE (COSTA
RICA), IS DRAWING CLOSER.

   THE FECMAFAM OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY TO PROTEST "AN
INCREASE IN REPRESSION AGAINST POPULAR ORGANIZATIONS UNLEASHED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S FASCIST GOVERNMENT," FECMAFAM SPOKESMEN SAID.

   MOST OF THOSE OCCUPYING THE EMBASSY ARE WOMEN WEARING WHITE SCARFS
AND YOUTHS CARRYING WET HANDKERCHIEFS TO AVOID THE EFFECTS OF TEAR
GAS.

   SANDOVAL DISCLOSED THAT A WORKING COMMISSION HAS BEEN FORMED TO
MAINTAIN CONSULTATIONS WITH THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT "AND IS MAKING
PERTINENT CONTACTS" TO SEEK A QUICK SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.

   THE OFFICIAL STRESSED: "WE WILL NOT BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS" WITH THE
EMBASSY OCCUPIERS, WHOM, ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, ARE ARMED.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THESE
INCIDENTS, FERNANDEZ HAD A SLIGHT CARDIAC PROBLEM, BUT HAS ALREADY
GOTTEN OVER IT.

   ACCORDING TO THIS OFFICIAL, FERNANDEZ' WIFE SENT HIM MEDICINE AND
FOOD.

   SANDOVAL ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WILL BE ISSUED
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 18 MAY 90 (EL GRAFICO) -- [TEXT] GENERAL HECTOR
GRAMAJO MORALES HAS REPORTED THAT LAST NIGHT'S TERRORIST ACTS WERE
PROBABLY INTENDED TO DAMAGE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS, BUT
ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WENT OFF PREMATURELY.

   HE ADDED THAT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HIT A WALL OF THE AIR
FORCE INSTALLATIONS AND THE SHOCK WAVE FROM THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED SOME
BUILDINGS.

   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS, THE ATTACK WAS PROBABLY A
PROPAGANDA PLOY BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE RUDIMENTARY AND SIMILAR TO
FIRECRACKERS.

   THE TERRORIST ACTIONS SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE
IRREGULAR GROUPS ARE SHRINKING CONSIDERABLY.  EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THE
FACT THAT A SUBVERSIVE WHO SURRENDERED ON THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS
CARRYING SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS ADMITTED
THAT THEY HAD MADE A BIG EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR PRESENCE, BUT THAT
NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL RESULTED AND THEY SUFFERED MANY CASUALTIES
INSTEAD, GRAMAJO SAID.

   WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THESE TERRORIST
ACTIONS ON THE TALKS BEING HELD IN OSLO, NORWAY, GRAMAJO SAID THAT
THOSE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THE TALKS DO NOT MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
THE GROUPS THAT CARRY OUT THE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   AMONG THOSE GROUPS, THERE IS ONE FACTION THAT IS CALLED THE
INTERNATIONAL MILITANT GROUP.  THIS FACTION IS COMPRISED OF PERSONS
WHO LOVE ADVENTURE; THESE PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS
TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES.
