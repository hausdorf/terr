   23 AUGUST 1989 THE EXTRADITABLES AND THE PEOPLE WHOSE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN
CONFISCATED STATE THE FOLLOWING TO THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE:  

   1.  WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE GOVERNMENT FOR PEACE SINCE THE TALKS IN
PANAMA IN 1984.  A LOT OF VIOLENCE COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.

   2. WE ACCEPTED THE PEACE PLAN PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT BARCO BUT WE RECEIVED
NO REPLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

   3.  THE ONLY REPLY WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
REPRESSION, ARBITRARY [WORDS INDISTINCT] UNJUST ARREST OF OUR RELATIVES,
LOOTING OF OUR HOUSES.

   4.  ALL KINDS OF JURIDICAL VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED AGAINST US.

   5.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS BRIBED JUSTICE WITH [WORDS INDISTINCT], DIPLOMATIC
SINECURES, AND TRIPS ABROAD.

   6.  THE ACTIONS OF CONFISCATION ARE NOTHING NEW; THEY HAVE ALWAYS
PREVAILED IN OUR COUNTRY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] WERE UNJUSTLY ARRESTED AND
IMPRISONED, EVEN THOUGH NO ARREST WARRANTS HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST THEM, AND
MANY OF OUR PROPERTIES AND POSSESSIONS WERE ARBITRARILY CONFISCATED OR
USURPED.

   7.  COLOMBIAN CITIZENS CHARGED WITH MONEY LAUNDERING HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED
AND WILL BE EXTRADITED, ALTHOUGH THIS REPRESENTS A VIOLATION OF COLOMBIAN
LAWS.  

   8.  WE ALWAYS WERE, ARE, AND WILL BE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE BUT WE
WILL NOT LOWER OUR GUARD AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR STRUGGLE AND WIDESPREAD
WAR AGAINST TRAITORS AND TURNCOATS.

   9.  WE DECLARE A WIDESPREAD AND TOTAL WAR ON THE GOVERNMENT, THE
INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY, THE JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE ATTACKED AND
MISTREATED US, JUDGES WHO HAVE BEEN BRIBED BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE
EXTRADITING MAGISTRATES, THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATION PRESIDENTS, AND ALL THOSE
WHO HAVE PERSECUTED US IN THE PAST.

   10.  WE WILL NOT RESPECT THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOT RESPECTED OUR
FAMILIES. WE WILL KILL THEM, AND WE WILL BURN AND DESTROY THE OLIGARCHY'S
INDUSTRIES, PROPERTIES, AND MANSIONS.

   (SIGNED) THE EXTRADITABLES.
