   BOGOTA, 27 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
REPORTER ON THE SCENE BY STUDIO REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER, IN
PROGRESS] ... IF THE COLLEAGUES AT THE CENTRAL STUDIO HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS FOR THE BOGOTA ELECTRICAL ENERGY INSTITUTE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS
AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT.  WE ARE OBSERVING A TERRIBLE SCENE OF
DESOLATION AND DEATH BECAUSE ALL THE PASSANGERS GOING TO CALI, VALLE
DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT, DIED.  THERE IS NO SINGLE SURVIVOR ACCORDING TO
NATIONAL POLICE REPORTS.  THEY ARE AWAITING CRIMINAL INSTRUCTION
JUDGES.  HOWEVER, THE ELECTRICITY COMPANY WORKER MAY ANSWER QUESTIONS
POSED BY STUDIO REPORTERS.  LATER ON WE WILL HAVE MORE OFFICIAL
INFORMATION.

   [STUDIO REPORTER] CAN YOU CONFIRM THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE'S BOMB
SQUAD?  AUTHORITIES FEAR THE CRASH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN
EXPLOSION RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT INSIDE THE AIRPLANE.

   [REPORTER] THE F-2 JUDICIAL POLICE AND CRIMINAL STATISTICS EXPERTS
ARE HERE.  THEY FEEL THAT THE ACCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A
TERRORIST ACTION.  THE REMARK WAS MADE BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS.
THEY NOTED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK BECAUSE
AIRPLANES DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF ACCIDENT UNLESS THERE IS AN
EXPLOSION, SOMETHING THAT HAS VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.  ACCORDING TO
REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL POLICE F-2 EXPERTS, THE AIRPLANE BROKE INTO
SIX PIECES.  IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, WHICH IS WHY THE 106
PASSENGERS ABOARD ARE STREWN ACROSS AN AREA 6-8 KM WIDE.

   ACCESS TO THE AIRPLANE'S REMAINS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS A
MOUNTAINOUS REGION.  THE CASQUITO [WORD INDISTINCT] IS THROUGH THE
ROAD THAT GOES FROM BOSA, CUNDINAMARCA DEPARTMENT, TO THE SCHOOL [NOT
FURTHER IDENTIFIED].  AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS AREA IS LOCATED VERY
CLOSE TO SLUICE NUMBER 3, MUNA 3, WHICH FEEDS WATER TO THE DAM.  THE
SITUATION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DRAMATIC.  RIGHT NOW, EXPERTS ARE
COLLECTING SAMPLES AND TRYING FIND ALL THEY CAN TO LEARN FOR SURE IF
THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACTION OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT CAUSED BY A FLAW IN
THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF THE HK-1803 AIRPLANE.
