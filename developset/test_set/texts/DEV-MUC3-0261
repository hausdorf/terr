   CLANDESTINE, 23 JUN 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] CONCERNING
THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON FRIDAY, 23 JUNE AT THE SAN SALVADOR CENTRAL
MARKET IN WHICH 2 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 30 WOUNDED, THE FMLN REPORTS
TO ALL SALVADORANS THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THAT THE HURLING OF THE BOMB AT THE CENTRAL MARKET WAS A TERRORIST
ACTION BY THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT,
SPECIFICALLY BY THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.  THIS ACTION IS PART OF A
COLD-BLOODED PLAN THAT CONSISTS OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS IN PUBLIC PLACES
DESIGNED TO TURN PEOPLE AGAINST THE FMLN.

   2.  WE HOLD COLONEL MAURICIO GUZMAN AGUILAR -- WHO ACQUIRED EXPERIENCE IN
THIS KIND OF CRIMINAL ACTION WHEN HE COMMANDED THE 5TH BRIGADE --
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TREACHEROUS TERRORIST ACTION.  THIS TERRORIST ACTION
COMPLEMENTS THE CURRENT POLICY OF REPRESSION BY THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME.

   WE CONDEMN TERRORISM [WORDS INDISTINCT] BY ARENA [WORDS INDISTINCT].
