   SAN SALVADOR, 5 OCT 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] TODAY, RELIEF
ORGANIZATIONS EVACUATED DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LOCKED INSIDE "LA
CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING IN SAN SALVADOR WHERE THE COSTA RICAN
EMBASSY IS LOCATED.  HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BE OCCUPIED BY
APPROXIMATELY 50 DEMONSTRATORS.

   AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ AND ANOTHER TWO DIPLOMATS, AS WELL AS
THREE SALVADORAN TELEVISION JOURNALISTS, ARE STILL BEING HELD HOSTAGE.

   APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE LEFT THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY WERE LOCKED
FOR 5 HOURS FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS AND
SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES
OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES (FECMAFAM) OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND
MURDERED AND MISSING PEOPLE.

   THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICIALS STILL REMAIN ON THE
THIRD FLOOR OF THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF RIOT
POLICEMEN EXPERT IN ANTITERRORIST STRUGGLE, ARMED WITH HIGH-CALIBER
RIFLES.

   RED CROSS, GREEN CROSS, AND RELIEF COMMAND MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN
THE EVACUATION OF THE OFFICES IN THE BUILDING.

   COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN
NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED WITHIN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS, BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES RULED OUT THE USE OF FORCE.

   MAURICIO SANDOVAL, DIRECTOR OF THE PRESIDENCY'S COMMUNICATIONS
SECRETARIAT, WENT TO "LA CENTROAMERICANA" BUILDING, LOCATED IN EL
SALVADOR'S BUSINESS DISTRICT, TO LEARN ABOUT THE SITUATION AND
DESCRIBED THE OCCUPATION AS A "PROPAGANDA ACT" IN VIEW OF THE FACT
THAT THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND
THE GUERRILLAS, SCHEDULED FOR 16 AND 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE (COSTA
RICA), IS DRAWING CLOSER.

   THE FECMAFAM OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY TO PROTEST "AN
INCREASE IN REPRESSION AGAINST POPULAR ORGANIZATIONS UNLEASHED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S FASCIST GOVERNMENT," FECMAFAM SPOKESMEN SAID.

   MOST OF THOSE OCCUPYING THE EMBASSY ARE WOMEN WEARING WHITE SCARFS
AND YOUTHS CARRYING WET HANDKERCHIEFS TO AVOID THE EFFECTS OF TEAR
GAS.

   SANDOVAL DISCLOSED THAT A WORKING COMMISSION HAS BEEN FORMED TO
MAINTAIN CONSULTATIONS WITH THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT "AND IS MAKING
PERTINENT CONTACTS" TO SEEK A QUICK SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.

   THE OFFICIAL STRESSED: "WE WILL NOT BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS" WITH THE
EMBASSY OCCUPIERS, WHOM, ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, ARE ARMED.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THESE
INCIDENTS, FERNANDEZ HAD A SLIGHT CARDIAC PROBLEM, BUT HAS ALREADY
GOTTEN OVER IT.

   ACCORDING TO THIS OFFICIAL, FERNANDEZ' WIFE SENT HIM MEDICINE AND
FOOD.

   SANDOVAL ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WILL BE ISSUED
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.
