   SAN SALVADOR, 18 MAR 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -- [TEXT] WE ARE
GOING TO GIVE YOU A REPORT ON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A FEW MINUTES
AGO IN THE CENTER OF SAN SALVADOR.  WE HAVE ON THE TELEPHONE A
LISTENER WHO IS GOING TO TELL US ABOUT TWO EXPLOSIONS JUST BEFORE NOON
THAT LEFT AT LEAST FIVE PERSONS WOUNDED.  PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH THE
REPORT.

   [LISTENER] SONORA LISTENERS, THIS IS A LAST MINUTE REPORT.  JUST A FEW
MINUTES AGO, AT 1130, TWO BOMBS EXPLODED HERE AT THE EASTERN END OF THE
CENTRAL MARKET.  FIVE PERSONS WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN THIS TERRORIST
ATTACK.  THEY WERE JUST TAKEN TO THE ROSALES HOSPITAL.  THE WOUNDED INCLUDE
A CHILD AND A WOMAN.  WE DID NOT GET THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES DID
NOT LET US DO SO.  RED CROSS PERSONNEL TOOK THE WOUNDED TO ROSALES HOSPITAL.

   THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE VERY FRIGHTENED AND ARE RUNNING AROUND.  THE
PEOPLE WERE BUYING FOOD WHEN THE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED.  THEY ARE NERVOUS AND
ARE TRYING TO QUICKLY FIND TRANSPORTATION.  THE EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD FAR
FROM HERE.  AT THE MARKET'S EASTERN GATE, WHERE THE FRUIT STANDS ARE
LOCATED, WE WERE TOLD BY PASSERSBY THAT A MAN WORKING THERE WAS THE MOST
SERIOUSLY WOUNDED BY THE BOMBS.  ALL THE WOUNDED WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.

   THE TERRORISTS LEFT A COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP BY THE
NATIONAL POLICE.

   THE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THE MARKET.  THEY CANNOT CONTINUE SHOPPING BECAUSE
IT IS ASSUMED THIS WAS A WARNING TO KEEP THE PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT OR GOING
TO VOTE.
