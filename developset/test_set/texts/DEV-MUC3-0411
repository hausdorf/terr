   SAN SALVADOR, 29 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] RICALDONE INSTITUTE
DIRECTOR FATHER GIUSSEPPE CORO PROTESTED TODAY THE MURDER OF A YOUNG
MECHANICS STUDENT AND LATER ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE THE INSTITUTE IN
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS AT WAR.  THE RICALDONE
INSITUTE IS ONE OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT SCHOOLS RUN BY SALESIAN PRIESTS
IN EL SALVADOR.

   FATHER CORO STATED DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT STUDENT MIGUEL
ERNESTO MIRANDA REINA, 18, "WHO WAS THE BEST MECHANICS STUDENT IN THE
INSTITUTE,' WAS DESPICABLY AND COWARDLY SHOT IN THE BACK WHEN HE WAS
ABOUT TO APPROACH HIS HOUSE IN WESTERN SAN SALVADOR ON 22 AUGUST.
FATHER CORO ACCUSED THE "ATLACATL" BATTALION SOLDIERS, PARTICULARLY AN
OFFICER, "A LIEUTENANT, SERGEANT, OR WHOMEVER," WHO LATER ATTEMPTED TO
DISTORT THE EVENT BY STATING THAT THE YOUNG STUDENT WAS A "REBEL"
BECAUSE HE WORE REBEL BOOTS AND HAD A REBEL BOOK.

   THE SALESIAN PRIEST, WHO HAS LIVED IN THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY
FOR THE PAST 16 YEARS, SAID THAT THE STUDENT WAS RETURNING HOME AFTER
WORKING ON HIS THESIS AS HE WAS TO GRADUATE THIS YEAR.  THE STUDENT
WORE THE SCHOOL'S UNIFORM, HAD HIS IDENTIFICATION PAPERS, AND CARRIED
A BOOK ON RELIGION THAT SHOWED JESUS CHRIST WITH A BEARD ON ITS COVER.

   FATHER CORO STATED THAT SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO KILL AN INNOCENT
YOUNG MAN WHO WAS AN HONOR STUDENT, THE SOLDIERS HAD STARTED TO KEEP A
WATCH ON THE INSTITUTE, TO STOP STUDENTS TO HARRASS THEM MENTALLY BY
ASKING THEM IF THEY KNEW MIRANDA REINA, TO PLACE A CHECKPOINT IN FRONT
OF THE MURDERED STUDENT'S HOME, AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES.  HE ADDED
THAT IF THESE MEASURES ARE NOT STOPPED, THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY IN EL
SALVADOR WILL PROTEST TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND.

   FATHER CORO STATED THAT THE SALESIAN COMMUNITY FEELS AFFECTED BY
THESE ACTIONS AS THEIR SCHOOLS HAVE ALWAYS EDUCATED THE YOUNG SO THAT
THEY CAN EARN A LIVILIHOOD AND THAT THESE MEASURES -- POSSIBLY ORDERED
BY MID-LEVEL COMMANDERS -- HINDER THEIR ACTIVITIES AND CAUSES
INSTABILITY IN THE STUDENT BODY THAT DOES NOT PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL
ADVANCEMENT.
