   GUATEMALA CITY, 20 MAY 88 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALA'S
CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION "SECRET ANTICOMMUNIST ARMY" (ESA) HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WEDNESDAY'S TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE RESIDENCE
AND OFFICE OF ALEKSANDR TRUSHIN, TASS CORRESPONDENT IN GUATEMALA.

   AN ESA BULLETIN DISTRIBUTED TO THE NEWS MEDIA STATES THAT THE
ATTACK AGAINST THE SOVIET NEWS AGENCY "WAS TO EXPRESS REJECTION OF THE
SOCIALIST-LEANING MEASURES" ADOPTED BY THE VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO
GOVERNMENT.

   THE DOCUMENT EXPLAINS THAT "THIS IS A WARNING," BECAUSE IF ARREST
WARRANTS ARE ISSUED FOR THE FIVE CIVILIANS INVOLVED IN THE ABORTIVE 11
MAY COUP, "ACTIONS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE
GUATEMALAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY," WHICH IS THE RULING PARTY.

   THE ATTACK, CARRIED OUT WITH TWO BOMBS, WAS PERPETRATED AGAINST THE
SOVIET NEWSMAN'S HOME, LOCATED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA SOUTH OF THIS
CITY.  THIS OCCURRED ON 18 MAY.

   THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WERE HURLED FROM AN AUTOMOBILE.  IT DESTROYED
AN ENTRANCE AND WINDOWS OF THE HOME AS WELL AS TRUSHIN'S CAR.
HOWEVER, NEITHER TRUSHIN NOR HIS WIFE WERE INJURED.

   THE COMMUNIQUE BY ESA, A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT EMERGED IN
THE 1960'S, ADDS THAT IT "WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION
HAS BEEN STOPPED AND ITS DEFEAT ACHIEVED."

   IT ALSO SAYS THAT "THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING REVOLUTION.
IF IT WANTS WAR, IT WILL HAVE WAR BECAUSE WE ARE READY TO DIE AND TO
FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM ANY TIME."

   THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY COMMANDERS "UBICO TOROKZIK" AND "RAFAEL
NETANAGIUHI," SAYS THAT DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMEJO,
FOREIGN MINISTER ALFONSO CABRERA, AND PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO
PLANNED THE COUP.

   ACCORDING TO THIS COMMUNIQUE, IN THE RECENT TRIP TO CUBA BY RAQUEL
BLANDON, WIFE OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AREVALO, SHE MET WITH LIBYAN AHMAD
MUSTAFA [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] "TO ASK HIM FOR ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR
THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1990."

   ESA IS OPPOSED TO THE ISSUANCE OF ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST MARIO
DAVID GARCIA, DANILO ROCA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, GUSTAVO ANZUETO VIELMAN,
AND MARIO CASTEJON.  THESE ARE THE CIVILIANS WHOM THE CEREZO AREVALO
GOVERNMENT HAS ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT.

   THIS GROUP STRESSES THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS A "PLOY PROMOTED BY GEN
HECTOR GRAMEJO.  THAT IS THE BASEST THING THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER
COULD HAVE DONE: TO SELL HIMSELF AND HIS MILITARY COLLEAGUES."

   ESA MEMBERS DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS "GUATEMALA'S PROGRESSIVE
PATRIOTS," AND THEY REAFFIRM THAT THE ATTACK ON THE TASS MISSION "WAS
A WARNING."
