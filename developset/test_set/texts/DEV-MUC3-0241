   TEGUCIGALPA, 9 JUN 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT
TODAY DENOUNCED THE ASSASSINATION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENCY MINISTER JOSE
ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH IN AN ATTACK IN WHICH HIS BODYGUARD AND DRIVER
WERE ALSO KILLED.  

   HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN EUGENIO CASTRO TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN SAN SALVADOR "IS INHUMANE," AND ADDED THAT "THIS IS NOT
THE WAY TO BEHAVE, ESPECIALLY IN A COUNTRY WHERE ELECTIONS WERE HELD AND THE
PEOPLE SELECT THEIR LEADERS."

   THE DEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVE IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PEOPLES HAVE, AND VIOLENCE IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO THE DEMOCRATIZATION
PROCESS IN THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION," CASTRO ADDED.

   RODRIGUEZ PORTH, 65, WAS KILLED BY ALLEGED URBAN GUERRILLAS, WHO
MACHINEGUNNED HIS RESIDENCE, ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN POLICE REPORTS.  

   HE WAS SWORN IN AS THE PRESIDENCY MINISTER ON 1 JUNE, 2 HOURS AFTER
ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION.
