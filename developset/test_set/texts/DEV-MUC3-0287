DEV-MUC3-0287 (INTEL TEXT PROC)

   BOGOTA, 10 JUL 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] AFTER SPENDING 130 DAYS ABROAD,
BERNARDO JARAMILLO, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFT-WING PATRIOTIC UNION (UP),
RETURNED TO COLOMBIA TODAY TO URGE THE CASTROITE ARMY OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION (ELN) TO JOIN THE PEACE PROCESS BEING PROMOTED BY THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT.  

   JARAMILLO, A 35-YEAR-OLD LEGISLATOR, REPLACED JAIME PARDO LEAL AS UP
PRESIDENT AFTER PARDO LEAL WAS ASSASSINATED IN OCTOBER 1987.  JARAMILLO HAD
LEFT THE COUNTRY AFTER RECEIVING MANY DEATH THREATS.

   THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN SUBVERSIVE GROUP THAT REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE
PEACE PROPOSALS FORMULATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO
AND INSTEAD HAS INCREASED ITS ATTACKS ON THE COUNTRY'S PETROLEUM
INSTALLATIONS TO DEMAND THE NATIONALIZATION OF THAT INDUSTRY.

   JARAMILLO ASKED THE ELN TO STOP ITS VIOLENT ACTIONS, WHICH, HE SAID, DO
NOT IN ANY WAY BENEFIT COLOMBIA.  

   THE LEFTIST LEADER SAID HE IS WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
DEVELOPMENT AND ADDED THAT "THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS
IMPROVED."

   THE BARCO ADMINISTRATION, HE SAID, HAS BEGUN TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT
CITIZENS.

   "MORE SECURITY MEASURES ARE NEEDED, BUT SOME MEASURES ARE BEING ADOPTED,"
JARAMILLO SAID.  HE STRESSED THAT IF ALL THE SUBVERSIVE GROUPS DECIDE TO
HOLD A SINCERE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE, IT WOULD BE VERY POSITIVE FOR THE COUNTRY.
