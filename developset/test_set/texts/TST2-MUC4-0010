   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA
BY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [AMAT] MR.
PRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS
EXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN
GENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS
LLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU?

   [GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO
EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER
ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS
CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE
PRESIDENCY?

   [GARCIA] WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE.

   [AMAT] WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE
SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.  HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY
HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND
DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE
OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS
ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.
FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE
PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF
TRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT
FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU
THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND
ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO
EDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.

   [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL
PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS
HIM.

   [GARCIA] BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE
ME AS PRESIDENT.  [LAUGHTER]

   [AMAT] EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE?

   [GARCIA] I DID NOT SAY SO.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I NEVER FALL TO THE
LEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES.  I MAKE AN
OUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE.

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THIS DIALOGUE [WORDS
INDISTINCT] FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE
AND OUR COUNTRY, [WORDS INDISTINCT], HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE
SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION
THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED,
MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED
STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOT
ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL
TACKLE IT.  THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO
BOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE
CONTINENT.  AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS.  LET COLOMBIANS HAVE
CONFIDENCE.
