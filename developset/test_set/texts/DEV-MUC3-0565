   SAN SALVADOR, 10 OCT 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] SEVERAL
SALVADORAN SECTORS HAVE CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF THE WIFE OF THE DEPUTY
EDITOR OF EL DIARIO DE HOY.  SHE WAS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS NEAR THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY THIS MORNING.  SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS DESCRIBED THE ACTION AS TERRORIST.  HE SAID THIS
IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH WILL SURELY ALSO BE
CONDEMNED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PASTOR
RIBREJO, WHO IS IN THE COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE LAST STRAW IS THAT TERRORISTS,
WITHOUT ANY RISK TO THEMSELVES, KILL DEFENSELESS WOMEN.  THIS
PARTICULAR LADY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM WAS
WOUNDED.  WE THINK THIS IS THE LIMIT.  WE ARE NOT SURE WHO DID IT,
BUT, CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THE ACTION, IT APPEARS TO BE A
TERRORIST CRIME.  WE ALREADY KNOW WHO PERPETRATES SUCH ACTIONS.  WE
THINK THIS IS PART OF WHAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] HAS BEEN DOING.  THEY HAVE BEEN SILENCING VOICES
THAT UPHOLD PHILOSOPHIES THAT RUN CONTRARY TO THEIR'S.  [END
RECORDING]

   REFERRING TO THE PRESENCE OF PASTOR RIBREJO IN THE COUNTRY,
CRISTIANI SAID THE UN OFFICIAL WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE POLICY
OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES DOES NOT FIT THE
VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I WILL NOT REFER TO MONSIGNOR ARTURO
RIVERA Y DAMAS ALONE, BUT TO ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LINKED TO THE
FMLN THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT.  I THINK DR
RIBREJO WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE
ARMED FORCES ARE IN THE HABIT OF VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS.  I THINK IF
ONE TRIES TO BE OBJECTIVE AND REALISTIC, HE WILL REALIZE THAT THE FMLN
HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THE HOMELAND FALL INTO A STATE OF TOTAL
ANARCHY. I THINK THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ACTED VERY PROFESSIONALLY.  THE
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRY TO SEEK SOLUTIONS THROUGH REASON
RATHER THAN VIOLENCE.  THESE EVENTS MUST BE SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT
THE FMLN SAID IT WOULD DO.  IT SAID IT WOULD UNLEASH EVEN GREATER
VIOLENCE. [END RECORDING]

   AS FOR THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER, CRISTIANI SAID A COMMISSION IS READY TO RESUME TALKS
WITH THE FMLN, TO WHICH A CEASE-FIRE WILL BE PROPOSED, AMONG OTHER
THINGS. CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED
WORKING ON THE LOGISTICS OF THE MEETING SO THE TALKS CAN BE HELD IN
PEACE.
