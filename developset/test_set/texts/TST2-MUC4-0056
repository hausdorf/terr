   SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [REPORT] [OSCAR
VENANCIO RAMIREZ] [TEXT] DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL EUGENIO VIDES
CASANOVA HAS VISITED LA ALAMEDA ROOSEVELT TO OBSERVE THE VOTING
PROCESS.  HE ALSO SAID AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE CONDUCTED INTO THE
MURDERS OF THREE REPORTERS, TWO SALVADORANS AND A NETHERLANDER.  THERE
WILL ALSO BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE WOUNDING OF A SALVADORAN
REPORTER AND A CBS REPORTER.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VIDES] THIS IS THE SAME QUESTION ASKED [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  THE ELECTION PROCESS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY IN ALL
MUNICIPALITIES EXCEPT SEVEN.  CLASHES WERE REPORTED IN TWO
MUNICIPALITIES AND THE ELECTIONS WERE SUSPENDED IN TWO OTHERS.  ONE OF
THEM IS EL SAUCE, WITH WHICH COMMUNICATIONS HAVE BEEN CUT OFF.  THE
OTHER IS SANTA ELENA, WHERE A CLASH OCCURRED.  I THINK PEOPLE WILL
VOTE HERE LATER.  NO VOTING IS TAKING PLACE IN FOUR OTHER
MUNICIPALITIES.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [VIDES] I HAVE NO OTHER INFORMATION.  AT THE TIME I DEPARTED, I
SENT FOR REPORTS FROM THE HOSPITAL.  I WAS TOLD HE DIED, BUT WE HAVE
TO GATHER MORE DATA ON HOW THE INCIDENT HAPPENED.

   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]

   [VIDES] WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD REPORTERS IN THE HIGHEST REGARD.  ALL
ARMED FORCES MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS.  BUT PROBLEMS ARISE
WHEN SOME PEOPLE IGNORE CHECKPOINTS AND THE GUARDS TRY TO STOP THEM.
I HEREBY APPEAL TO PEOPLE TO OBEY CHECKPOINTS.  WE ARE THE FIRST TO
REGRET THESE INCIDENTS.  WE HAVE VERY GOOD AND CLOSE RELATIONS WITH
THE MEDIA AND KNOW [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   [REPORTER] WILL THIS HAVE REPERCUSSIONS?

   [VIDES] SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS WILL CERTAINLY OCCUR, BUT YOU CAN
REST ASSURED THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS UNINTENTIONAL.  SOME PEOPLE
IGNORED THE ORDER TO STOP.  THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE MORE ALERT AND AWARE
OF THE SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE REBELS' ATTACKS.  [END RECORDING]
