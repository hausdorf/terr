THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, AND PERU BEGAN
DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUSTING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT
AND EVENTUALLY ACCEPTING ECUADOR IN ITS PLACE.  THE POSSIBILITY OF
EXPELLING PANAMA FROM THE GROUP WAS DISCUSSED EVEN THOUGH ARGENTINE
FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO SAID THE ISSUE WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA.

   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OUSTING OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT
AND REPLACING IT WITH ECUADOR, ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO
CAVALLO TOLD EFE: "WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO THE PROPOSAL, BUT WE
PREFER NOT TO COMMENT FOR THE TIME BEING.  WE WILL SEE WITHIN THE
CONTEXT OF THE MEETING WHAT THE BASIS FOR THAT PROPOSAL IS."

   CAVALLO ADDED: "WE DO NOT HAVE PROPOSALS OR INITIATIVES ANY
DIFFERENT FROM THE ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED ON PANAMA."

   MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTER FERNANDO SOLANA TOLD EFE THAT THE
PREPARATORY FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING WILL DISCUSS THE PANAMANIAN
ISSUE AND THAT MEXICO WILL DECIDE ITS STANCE "AT THE APPROPRIATE
TIME."

   BRAZILIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ROBERTO DE ABREU SAID IN THIS CITY
YESTERDAY THAT BRAZIL HAS AN INDIVIDUAL POSITION "BUT WILL ACCEPT AND
SUPPORT A JOINT AGREEMENT."

   PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX ALSO SAID YESTERDAY
THAT PERU WILL PROPOSE "THE FINAL SEPARATION OF PANAMA" FROM THE GROUP
OF EIGHT.

   LARCO ADDED THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL PROPOSE THE SEPARATION
OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP DURING THE SUMMIT MEETING THAT WILL BE HELD
WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, URUGUAY,
AND VENEZUELA ON 11 AND 12 OCTOBER.  THE MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE IN
ICA, 850 KM SOUTH OF TRUJILLO.

   TODAY LARCO COX OPENED THE GROUP OF EIGHT FOREIGN MINISTERS'
MEETING IN TRUJILLO.  THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA
WERE ABSENT BECAUSE THEY WILL GO DIRECTLY TO ICA WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE
PRESIDENTS.

   IN A BRIEF SPEECH, LARCO COX CALLED ON THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES TO
STRUGGLE FOR THE UNITY, INTEGRATION, AND INDEPENDENCE IN THE REGION.

   COX ADDED: "WE MUST WORK FOR OVERALL DEVELOPMENT. WE PROPOSE AS AN
ACT OF JUSTICE THE INTEGRATION OF THE CONTINENT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE."

   HE ADDED THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS CANNOT BE AN ISOLATED PROCESS
AND THAT UNITY CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF THE COUNTRIES RESCUE THE
HISTORIC VALUES WHICH CONSOLIDATED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE AMERICAS.

   THE MINISTERS ALSO DISCUSSED, IN ADDITION TO THE PANAMANIAN AND
ECUADORAN CASE, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM, JOINT ACTION TO DEAL
WITH THE REGION'S FOREIGN DEBT, ESTIMATED AT $420 BILLION, AND
TERRORISM.

   THE PROPOSALS MADE IN TRUJILLO WILL BE DISCUSSED BY THE SEVEN
PRESIDENTS IN ICA.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING IS BEING HELD UNDER POLICE AND
 MILITARY CONTROL TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. ON 4 OCTOBER A CAR
BOMB EXPLODED ABOUT 500 METERS FROM THE MEETING SITE.  FORTUNATELY,
THERE WAS ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE.

   SOME OF THE SECURITY MEASURES INCLUDED THE CHANGE OF THE FOREIGN
MINISTERS' ARRIVAL TIMES AND SOME CHANGES IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM.

   THERE IS STRICT POLICE CONTROL NEAR THE CESAR VALLEJO CIVIC CENTER
WHERE THE MINISTERS ARE MEETING.  VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC WAS
PROHIBITED WITHIN ABOUT 200 METERS OF THE CENTER.

   THE FIRST MEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT WAS HELD IN ACAPULCO,
MEXICO, IN 1987, AND THE SECOND MEETING WAS HELD IN PUNTA DEL ESTE,
URUGUAY, IN 1988.
