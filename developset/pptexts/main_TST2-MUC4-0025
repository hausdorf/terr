DEARLY" FOR HAVING "INTERVENED" IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.

   A COMMUNIQUE BY THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG),
RELEASED IN COSTA RICA, STRESSED THAT 126 ELITE TROOPS OF THE
GUATEMALAN ARMY, KNOWN AS KAIBILES, ARE COLLABORATING WITH SALVADORAN
SOLDIERS TO PUT AN END TO THE OFFENSIVE BY GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).

   THE URNG CHARGE, ALSO PRESENTED BY THE FMLN, HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY
AND REPEATEDLY DENIED BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESWOMAN CLAUDIA
ARENAS.

INTERVENTION OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN
PEOPLE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY
FOR THIS AGGRESSION."

FOLLOWING FIERCE FIGHTING THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEAD AND MORE
THAN 1,500 WOUNDED IN THE PAST 7 DAYS.

IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   THE URNG DECLARATION IS SIGNED BY COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR
