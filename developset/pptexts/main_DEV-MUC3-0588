 RUBEN ZAMORA, LEADER OF THE
POPULAR SOCIAL CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE, WAS
UNHARMED FOLLOWING A TERRORIST ATTACK.

   ZAMORA SAID THE COUNTRY IS SUFFERING FROM A WAVE OF VIOLENCE
LAUNCHED BY GROUPS THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS TO SUCCEED. HE
ALSO SAID THERE ARE ULTRARIGHTIST GROUPS THAT DO NOT SEEK A NEGOTIATED
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEIR INTERESTS WILL BE HARMED, AND
ADDED THAT THERE ARE GROUPS WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA
 THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS.
HE SAID THESE GROUPS TEND TO REACT WITH INCREASED VIOLENCE.
