  COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ,
FOLLOWING RECENT INCIDENTS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS SUCH AS THE ATTACK ON
FENASTRAS , THE U.S.
OFFICIAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS
BERNARD ARONSON CAME TO OUR COUNTRY.  HE SAID THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE
WILL DEPEND . WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIS VISIT TO
OUR COUNTRY?

    IT IS BASICALLY AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S PRESTIGE
AND IMAGE, AS THIS HAS BEEN A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY NEED A POTABLE IMAGE, AN IMAGE
THAT PORTRAYS LEGITIMACY, AND AN IMAGE OF MODERATION THAT WILL NOT
ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT INTERNATIONALLY. THE FENASTRAS INCIDENT
UNDOUBTEDLY UNMASKED CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE, ARONSON'S
VISIT IS AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S IMAGE AND SUPPORTING CRISTIANI'S
INITIATIVE OF CREATING A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THOSE INCIDENTS, IN
ORDER TO FOSTER HOPES AND CREDIBILITY AMONG SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE
GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IN CLARIFYING THE INCIDENTS. THAT WAS ARONSON'S
INTENTION.

   AS A MATTER OF FACT, CRISTIANI'S IMAGE IS IMPORTANT FOR THE AID
ITSELF. ASPECTS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN
THE DEBATES AT THE U.S. CONGRESS, WHERE THE AID IS APPROVED.
THEREFORE, THAT AID WOULD BE ENDANGERED IF THE DEBATES ON VIOLATIONS
OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR ARE INTENSIFIED. IT COULD HAVE AN
EFFECT ON THAT. SO WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO SAVE IS THE AID TO
CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE WAR.

   IN THAT REGARD, WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT WITHIN THE DOCTRINE OF
LOW INTENSITY WARFARE, THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY
PLAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE  THAT WILL NOT APPEAR TO
BE IN THE EXTREME RIGHT; A GOVERNMENT THAT APPEARS TO BE MORE IN THE
CENTER THAN IN THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN ORDER TO CREATE EXPECTATIONS
WITHIN SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT'S CREDIBILITY, AND ALSO AT
THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WHILE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE REBELS MILITARILY
AND THROUGH REPRESSION, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE
IMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT.

    YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL-DIPLOMATIC
COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THE FENASTRAS INCIDENTS, OUR FRONT
CANCELLED ITS ATTENDANCE AT THE CARACAS MEETING. WHAT ARE THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR RESTORING THE TALKS AND CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE -
NEGOTIATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT?

    THE FMLN IS INTERESTED IN A REAL DIALOGUE, A DIALOGUE
THAT WILL LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT; IN OTHER
WORDS, A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO NEGOTIATIONS.  WE DIFFER WITH
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT ON THIS.  FROM THE BEGINNING, ARENA
 HAS EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO
PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE, BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE.  THEY HAVE A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT CONCEPT.
