 THERE IS
PROFOUND INDIGNATION OVER THE MURDER OF DR.  FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO,
PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE.  THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED
BY TERRORISTS AT ABOUT 0930  THIS MORNING.  ACCORDING TO
WITNESSES, THE TERRORISTS DROVE A YELLOW VOLKSWAGEN.

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ORDERED A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION TO
DETERMINE WHO MURDERED DR GUERRERO AND TO BRING THEM TO TRIAL
ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN PENAL CODE, WHICH WAS MODIFIED A FEW DAYS
AGO.  BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THESE
CRIMES, BECAUSE THEY ONLY BRING MORE GRIEF AND PAIN TO THE SUFFERING
SALVADORAN PEOPLE.
