 ONLY HOURS BEFORE TOMORROW'S ELECTIONS BEGIN AT 0700,
BEFORE THE PEOPLE BEGIN CASTING THEIR VOTES TO ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT
AND VICE PRESIDENT, THE FMLN  CONTINUES WITH ITS TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE AND ITS ATTACKS ON
MILITARY GARRISONS.

   TODAY AT APPROXIMATELY 2130 , A GROUP OF REBELS LAUNCHED A
SURPRISE ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE.  SOME
SHOTS WERE FIRED, SOME BAZOOKAS WERE ALSO FIRED, BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN IF
THEY ACTUALLY HIT A TARGET INSIDE THE BASE.  HOWEVER, AIR FORCE SPOKESMEN
HAVE SAID THAT THE ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED FROM SANTA LUCIA COLONIA.  NO DAMAGE
OR CASUALTIES RESULTED FROM THIS ATTACK ON THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS BY
FMLN REBELS.  THE SOLDIERS GUARDING THE AREA REPELLED THE REBEL ATTACK.

   A SEARCH OPERATION IS UNDER WAY IN THE AREA TO FIND THE REBELS WHO
ATTACKED THE AIR FORCE BASE THIS EVENING.  NO CASUALTIES OR DAMAGE RESULTED
FROM THIS ATTACK.
