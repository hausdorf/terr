 THE NATIONAL POLICE
ANNOUNCED ON 20 JANUARY THAT IT HAS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE GUILT OF U.S.
CITIZEN JENNIFER JEAN CASOLO, WHO WAS ARRESTED ON 24 NOVEMBER IN HER HOME IN
THE MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS CAPITAL, WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS
AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF DOCUMENTS BELONGING TO THE FMLN-FDR  WERE FOUND
BURIED IN THE YARD.

   CASOLO WAS ARRAIGNED 8 DAYS  AFTER HER ARREST, BUT
WAS RELEASED BY THE JUDGE "FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE," ACCORDING TO THE
JUDICIAL RECORDS.

   ALTHOUGH IN SALVADORAN JUDICIAL CIRCLES IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY CASOLO
WAS RELEASED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL FACTORS
INVOLVED.

   AT PRESENT, CASOLO HEADS GROUPS THAT HAVE LAUNCHED A VIRULENT
CAMPAIGN AGAINST EL SALVADOR IN THE UNITED STATES, CLAIMING ALLEGED
"RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION."

   CASOLO WAS CAPTURED AFTER THE TERRORIST FAUSTO GALLARDO VALDEZ GAVE
HER NAME TO THE POLICE, TELLING THEM WHERE TO FIND THE WEAPONS THAT HE
AND HIS ACCOMPLICES USED FOR TERRORIST ACTS.  THE PRISONER SAID THAT
THE WEAPONS WERE PROVIDED BY CASOLO AT HER HOME IN THE MIRALVALLE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH SERVED AS A CLANDESTINE ARSENAL.

   IN VIEW OF THIS CONFESSION, THE POLICE REQUESTED THE PARTICIPATION
OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. EMBASSY, WHO WERE PRESENT IN THE COURSE
OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND WHEN THE WEAPONS WERE DUG UP IN FRONT OF CASOLO
HERSELF.

   WHEN CASOLO RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES, SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE
HAD BURIED DOCUMENTS IN THE YARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE SHE LIVED, BUT SHE
LIED BY SAYING THAT SHE DID THIS BECAUSE "IN EL SALVADOR PEOPLE
COMMONLY BURY DOCUMENTS OR JEWELS TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING STOLEN BY
CRIMINALS."

   SOURCES SAY THAT AT PRESENT, AT THE HEAD OF GROUPS OF COMMUNISTS
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHO SUPPORT THEIR
SALVADORAN COUNTERPARTS, CASOLO HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO
DISCREDIT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNRMENT AND TO PRESSURE CONGRESS TO
REDUCE OR ELIMINATE AID TO OUR COUNTRY IN ORDER TO WEAKEN THE COUNTRY
INSTITUTIONALLY AND STRENGTHEN THE FMLN-FDR TERRORIST GROUPS.

   THE POLICE REPORT THAT THE TERRORIST GALLARDO VALDEZ, FROM WHOM
WEAPONS AND AMMOUNITION WERE SEIZED ON 24 NOVEMBER, SAID THAT HE HAD
OBTAINED THE WEAPONS AT THE HOME OF A WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE A
FOREIGNER ON BARCELONA AVENUE, MIRALVALLE NEIGHBORHOOD, IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   THAT SAME DAY, POLICE INVESTIGATORS LOCATED THE HOUSE, IDENTIFIED
THE PERSON LIVING THERE, AND INVITED U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE SEARCH.

   BURIED AT THE HOUSE THEY FOUND 103 SHELLS FOR 60-MM MORTARS, 213
STICKS OF TNT, 405 ELECTRIC DETONATING CAPS, 150 FEET OF SLOW FUSES,
15 KNIVES, 3 CARTRIDGE CLIPS FOR AK-47 RIFLES, 12,510 AK-47 SHELLS,
9,110 M-16 RIFLE SHELLS, 325 G-3 RIFLE SHELLS, AND DOCUMENTS.

   IN HER UNOFFICIAL STATEMENT, CASOLO SAID THAT SHE DID NOT BELONG TO
ANY SUBVERSIVE GROUP OR ASSOCIATION, AND THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE
ARTICLES CAME TO BE IN HER HOUSE.

   ON 5 DECEMBER, CASOLO AND A GROUP OF SALVADORANS WERE ARRAIGNED
BEFORE A MILITARY JUDGE, WHO 5 DAYS LATER RELEASED THEM "FOR LACK OF
EVIDENCE."

   ON 9 DECEMBER, POLICEMEN ARRESTED A WOMAN NAMED RUTH ESPERANZA
AGUILAR MARROQUIN, ALIAS MARINA, WHO WAS FLEEING AFTER HAVING PLACED A
BOMB IN THE ENGINE OF A BUS. ON BEING QUESTIONED, SHE SAID SHE WAS AN
ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, THAT THE PERSON IN
CHARGE OF LOGISTICS WAS THE AMERICAN, CASOLO, AND THAT SHE HAD
OBTAINED THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL AT CASOLO'S HOME IN MIRALVALLE.

   THE POLICE HAVE DENIED CASOLO'S CHARGES THAT DURING HER DETENTION
SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE, BECAUSE IT
CAN PROVE THAT WHILE CASOLO WAS UNDER ARREST, SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
AN EMBASSY OFFICIAL, EVEN AT MEALTIME.
