 FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
OF M-19  PRESIDENT CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ, THE GROUP'S
NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT HIS GROUP WILL
CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE.  THE M-19, THE ORGANIZATION THAT SIGNED A
PEACE AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ON 8 MARCH AND
LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY, SAID THAT IT
WILL NOT PICK UP ITS WEAPONS AGAIN AS A RESULT OF THE MURDER OF THE
39-YEAR-OLD PIZARRO.  PIZARRO WAS BURIED YESTERDAY.  ONLY 50 DAYS AFTER
REJOINING CIVILIAN LIFE FOLLOWING MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF ARMED STRUGGLE,
PIZARRO BECAME A SYMBOL FOR PEACE, ALTHOUGH, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS, WITH
HIS DEATH HIS KILLERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY.

   WHEN ACCEPTING THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF,
A 42-YEAR-OLD ENGINEER, FORMER DEAN OF A UNIVERSITY, REBEL, AND THE
OLDEST OF SEVEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS, SAID THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT FOR THAT COLOMBIA WHICH WANTS DEMOCRACY AND WISHES TO LIVE
IN PEACE.  THE NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS FORCED TO SPEAK AND
ACCEPT THE NOMINATION WHEN PIZARRO'S FUNERAL PROCESSION MADE A STOP AT
THE HOME OF THE LIBERATOR SIMON BOLIVAR.  HE SAID THAT THE COLOMBIAN
PEOPLE MUST UNITE TO MAKE HARMONY POSSIBLE, AND HE URGED EVERYONE TO
CONTRIBUTE TO A FUTURE OF PEACE, A BETTER FUTURE FOR COMING
GENERATIONS.  SPEAKING BEFORE PIZARRO'S CASKET, WHICH WAS DRAPED WITH
THE COLOMBIAN FLAG, NAVARRO, WHO IN 1985 SURVIVED AN ATTACK DURING
WHICH HE LOST A LEG, SWORE TO FIGHT FOR PEACE AS PIZARRO HAD DONE.

   THE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO ATTENDED SATURDAY'S FUNERAL CARRIED
PLACARDS WITH SLOGANS THAT READ: COMMANDER PIZARRO, WE CONTINUE
FORWARD, AND COMRADE PIZARRO, WE ARE FOR PEACE, WE SWEAR.  OTHERS WHO
JOINED THE THOUSANDS OF VOICES ASKING NAVARRO TO ACCEPT THE
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION BROKE THE SILENCE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO
CHANT: PIZARRO PRESENT, NAVARRO PRESIDENT.

   PIZARRO'S MOTHER MARGOT DE PIZARRO, ALONG WITH HIS LADY FRIEND
LAURA, SPOKE AT THE GRAVE SITE AND ASKED THE CROWD TO FIGHT FOR PEACE
AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE.

   AT THE CEMETERY THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AGAIN ADDRESSED THE
CROWD, WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE MORE THAN SEVEN-HOUR-LONG FUNERAL
PROCESSION FROM THE CATHEDRAL TO SIMON BOLIVAR'S HOME AND THEN TO THE
CEMETERY.  HE SAID: TOGETHER WITH ALL THE GOOD COLOMBIANS, WE ARE
GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY.  HE ADDED THAT PIZARRO'S MURDER
WAS USELESS BECAUSE THE M-19 WILL CONTINUE ITS STRUGGLE FOR PEACE.

   PIZARRO'S FUNERAL WAS HELD IN BOGOTA.  THE AUTHORITIES PRAISED THE
FACT THAT NO INCIDENTS OR PUBLIC DISORDERS DEVELOPED DURING THE
FUNERAL.  THE M-19 LEADERS HAD ASKED THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM.

   THE NEW COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THE SIXTH COMMANDER
M-19 HAS HAD, THE SECOND SINCE THE REBEL GROUP ENTERED ITS NEW PHASE
TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY.  ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF WILL BE RUNNING
AGAINST 12 OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY.
