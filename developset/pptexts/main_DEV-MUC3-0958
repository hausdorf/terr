  "JUST A FEW WORDS TO EXPLAIN THE CURRENT MILITARY
SITUATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT STILL, REGRETTABLY, FOLLOWING THE FMLN'S
 IRRATIONALITY, WE CANNOT RULE
OUT A CONTINUATION OF THEIR VIOLENT ACTIONS.  WE KNOW THAT AROUND THE
CAPITAL THERE ARE STILL GROUPS OF TERRORISTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN
AREA, IN THE NORTHWEST -- THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO-- AND IN THE NORTHEAST,
TO THE NORTH OF SOYAPANGO MUNCIPALITY.  THE MILITARY, HOWEVER, HAVE TAKEN
THE OFFENSIVE IN THESE THREE AREAS WHERE THE FMLN GROUPS HAVE BEEN CHASED.
FIGHTING HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, WITH OVER 100 CASUALTIES
INFLICTED UPON THE FMLN IN 3 DAYS.

   "WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE LEFT WITHIN THE CAPITAL GREAT
NUMBERS OF WEAPONS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED.  SOME GROUPS
ARE IN HIDING, USING CIVILIANS, AND ARE CARRYING OUT TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES.  THEY HAVE BURNED BUSES, GASOLINE STATIONS AND MURDERED DR
FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO; AND ON 7 DECEMBER, THEY FIRED THREE OR FOUR
MORTAR ROUNDS AT RANDOM, FALLING ON PRIVATE HOMES.  ONE OF THEM FELL
ON THE HOUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT.  WE BELIEVE
THESE ACTIONS ARE JUST MERE TERRORISM, INDISCRIMINATELY FIRING MORTARS
ON THE CAPITAL'S CIVILIANS.

   "WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO FURTHER CAPACITY EXCEPT TO CARRY OUT THESE
TERRORIST ACTS TO CREATE CONFUSION AND ANARCHY AMONG THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THANK GOD, OUR POPULATION IS VERY BRAVE AND HEROIC. WE
HAVE BEEN NOTICING WITH PRIDE HOW THE POPULATION HAS BEEN WORKING
NORMALLY IN ALL OF SAN SALVADOR, GOING TO THEIR JOBS, WITH BUSINESSES
OPENING AND TRYING TO OPERATE NORMALLY.  THERE ARE STILL SOME THREATS
IN THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL, WHERE A GROUP OF TERRORISTS ARE
CONCENTRATED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CITY.  HERE, TOO, THE ARMED
FORCES HAVE BEGUN AN OFFENSIVE AND QUICKLY END ANY IMMINENT DANGER."

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AT THE 10
DECEMBER PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF
RESTARTING A DIALOGUE WITH THE INSURGENTS ON 20 DECEMBER, IN CARACAS,
VENEZUELA, AS LONG AS THE FMLN NO LONGER CARRIES OUT ARMED ACTIONS IN
URBAN AREAS, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SHOULD
CONTINUE ACTIONS ONLY AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS.

    "AS YOU ALL HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER BEEN AGAINST CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS TO
FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  IT HAS BEEN THE
FMLN THAT UNILATERALLY BROKE THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS BY NOT TURNING UP
AT CARACAS, VENEZULA, AS HAD BEEN AGREED IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.  WE,
HOWEVER, ARE GOING TO MAKE A DEFINITE PROPOSAL IN COSTA RICA, WHICH IN
GENERAL TERMS IS AS FOLLOWS:

   "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO RESTART THE DIALOGUE
PROCESS.  MOST CONVENIENT WOULD BE FOR THIS TO TAKE PLACE IN CARACAS,
WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITION: BEGINING 15 DECEMBER, 3 DAYS AFTER THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL MEETING ,
THE FMLN SHOULD PUBLICLY DECLARE AND GIVE PROOF OF COMPLIANCE THAT IT
WILL END ALL TYPES OF TERRORIST ACTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT CIVILIANS.  WE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE NOT
ASKING THEM TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS, AS WAS ATTEMPTED MANY TIMES.  IF
THE FMLN CONTINUES ITS IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR, THE ARMED FORCES WILL
CONTINUE FIGHTING THEM.  TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST CIVILIANS MUST END.
THE PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO CONTINUE BEING THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE
IRRATIONALITY OF ALL THIS FIGHTING. WE THINK THE LEAST THE FMLN CAN DO
IS TO STOP ALL ACTIONS THAT AFFECT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION.  MILITARY TARGETS ARE SOMETHING ELSE; BUT IF WE
ANALYZE THINGS, UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT A SINGLE MILITARY OBJECTIVE WAS
THE TARGET SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.  THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO TAKE
OVER A CIVIL DEFENSE POST.  ALL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN AGAINST CIVILIANS,
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THEM, TRYING TO CREATE TERROR AMONG THE
POPULATION.  THE CESSATION OF TERRORIST ACTS SHOULD BE THE FMLN'S
PROOF OF SINCERITY AND WILL TO REALLY TRY AND SEEK A SOLUTION BY WAY
OF DIALOGUE.  IF THE FMLN TODAY ACCEPTS ENDING ALL ACTIONS AGAINST THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, THEN WE ARE WILLING ON 20 DECEMBER TO GO TO
CARACAS AND TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS AND TALKS ON ALL THE
TOPICS THE FMLN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT. THJIS WILL BE IN ORDER TO ENSURE
THAT BY 15 FEBRUARY WE HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT."
