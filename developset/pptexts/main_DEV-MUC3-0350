 FELLOW COUNTRYMEN:
I AM ADDRESSING YOU TO EXPLAIN THE MEASURES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF
THE STATE OF SIEGE  WHICH HAVE BEEN
ADOPTED AT A TIME WHEN THE NATION HAS JUSTIFIED REASONS TO FEEL ANGRY
AND MOVED BY THE SERIOUS ACTIONS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN
RECENT DAYS.  UNFORTUNATELY, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, THE LIBERAL PARTY
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, WAS THE VICTIM OF ANOTHER ATTACK TONIGHT.
SENATOR GALAN HAS BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL.  LET US PRAY TO GOD THAT
HE WILL RECOVER FROM HIS WOUNDS.

   THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS HAVE UNLEASHED A
WAVE OF ASSASSINATIONS AND DEATHS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS AGAINST
REPRESENTATIVES AND LEADERS FROM ALL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY AND FROM ALL
INSTITUTIONS.  HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, SEVERAL JUDGES, POLITICAL
LEADERS, SOLDIERS, CITIZENS, AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF
THIS BARBARISM.

   VIOLENCE AFFECTS ALL.  IT IS NOT AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR
AGAINST JUSTICE; IT IS A WAR AGAINST THE COUNTRY.  THEREFORE, THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY MUST RESPOND.  I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE MURDER OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS
VALENCIA LED THE JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO PROTEST AND TO REQUEST MORE
PROTECTION, BUT FOR THE MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES TO RESIGN ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO
WORSENING THE SITUATION WHICH WE MUST ALL SOLVE BY WORKING TOGETHER.  THIS
IS ALSO EQUIVALENT TO YIELDING TO THE TERRORISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO PARALYZE
THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

   TRUE HEROES SUCH AS CARLOS VALENCIA, WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND
OTHER JUDGES, POLICEMEN, SOLDIERS, AND BODYGUARDS HAVE PREVENTED THIS BY
FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES WITHOUT YIELDING TO INTIMIDATION OR BRIBERY.  I
INVITE ALL JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO RESUME THEIR WORK.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS
ADOPTED MORE MEASURES TO PROTECT THEM, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO RENDER ALL
THE COOPERATION THEY REQUIRE AND WHICH IS AVAILABLE.  ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS
MUST JOIN THE EFFORTS.  NO MORE LAMENTATIONS WITHOUT TRUE ACTION OF
COOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES.

   IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL FORCES OF THE STATE AND OF SOCIETY -- POLITICAL
PARTIES, UNIONS, MEDIA, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS -- ALL SERVE JUSTICE AND THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST CRIME.  WE MUST BE PREPARED TO ENDURE MORE SORROW AND
SUFFERINGS.  ONLY IF ALL COLOMBIA PERSEVERES IN A TRULY STRONG AND SOLID
MANNER -- BUT NOT JUST WITH WORDS -- IN THE DIFFICULT BATTLE AGAINST CRIME,
WILL WE BE ABLE TO BANISH VIOLENCE.
