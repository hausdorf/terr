 FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I ADDRESS YOU AT
A MOMENT WHEN ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS ARE FILLED WITH PAIN.  TERRORIST
ACTIONS HAVE BROUGHT SADNESS AND MOURNING TO DOZENS OF OUR POOR HOMES,
AS WELL AS TO FAMILIES OF NATIONAL LEADERS.  COLOMBIA'S ENEMIES HAVE
DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO ATTACKING UNARMED CITIZENS.  THEIR INSANE
ACTIONS ARE ENDING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND HONEST
COLOMBIANS.  AT THESE TRYING TIMES, I SEND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IRRATIONAL WAVE OF MONSTROUS CRIMES MY
DEEPEST SENTIMENTS OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TELL ALL THE VICTIMS'
RELATIVES AND FRIENDS THAT WE SHARE THEIR SORROW AND SADNESS.

   THE COUNTRY AND ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DEALT A STRONG BLOW
TODAY.  ANOTHER GREAT MAN HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED.  LIBERAL LEADER
FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ WAS VIOLENTLY MURDERED IN THE STREETS OF
MEDELLIN.  THE LOSS OF SENATOR ESTRADA VELEZ LEAVES THE LIBERAL PARTY
AND ANTIOQUIANS WITHOUT ONE OF ITS GREAT LEADERS.  HE IS TO BE ADDED
TO THE LIST OF MARTYRS THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THEIR THOUGHTS AND
BRAVE ATTITUDE IN CONFRONTING THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS.  FEDERICO
ESTRADA WAS A FIGHTER IN THIS ADMINISTARTION AND, AS OUR COLOMBIAN
AMBASSADOR TO ITALY, CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH
THAT COUNTRY AND WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE COUNTRY RECALLS HIM
FOR HIS RECENT ACTIONS AS THE PROPONENT AND PROMOTER OF THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROJECT AT THE SENATE.  HIS BRILLANT POLITICAL
AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER ALLOWED HIM TO REACH THE HIGHEST POSITIONS OF
THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS AND OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  HE WAS A SUPREME
COURT MAGISTRATE, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, PARLIAMENTARIAN, THE NATIONAL
AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, A PUBLIC SERVANT OF MANY
YEARS, AND A TIRELESS WORKER FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE PEOPLE OF
ANTIOQUA.  HIS LIFE WAS ENDED AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY AND HIS PARTY
NEEDED HIS EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE.

   TO HIS WIFE, HIS FOUR CHILDREN, HIS FOLLOWERS, AND ALL ANTIOQUEANS,
I SEND A HEARTFELT MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ALL HIS FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN.  THE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.  ALL
COLOMBIANS GET ANGRY EACH TIME A BARBARIC ACT TAKES PLACE AND EACH
TIME ONE OF OUR LEADERS IS MURDERED.  LET US TURN THIS ANGER INTO A
PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONS, IN A
DECIDED ACTION BY ALL AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF CRIME, AND IN EFFECTIVE
SOLIDARITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  RECOVERING PEACE AND
TRANQUILLITY IS A JOINT TASK.  EVERY DAY WE MUST DEMAND MORE
EFFICIENCY FROM OUR PUBLIC FORCES BUT WE MUST ALSO GIVE THEM MORE
SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THEIR
SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES.  THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING;
IT HAS SUPPORTED THEM MORALLY AND MATERIALLY.

   TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND IMPUNITY DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON THE
COOPERATION OF CITIZENS.  WE MUST ALL BECOME LIKE SOLDIERS IN THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE BECAUSE THE FUTURE OF OUR FAMILIES, OUR PRINCIPLES,
OUR RIGHTS, AND OUR DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE.  LET THOSE WHO PROMOTE
VIOLENCE FACE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY OF 30 MILLION HONEST COLOMBIANS.  NO
ONE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PAINFUL MOMENT THE COUNTRY IS
ENDURING.  THE INTERESTS OF COLOMBIA ARE ABOVE ALL OTHER
CONSIDERATIONS.

   ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE DECISION BY THE HONORABLE
SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND AFTER A
THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBANCES, I HAVE
DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE TO SEND THE FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPRESENT
COLOMBIA AT THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   AS YOU ARE AWARE, THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BEGIN
TOMORROW IN CUZCO, PERU.  THIS MEETING WAS CALLED WITH THE OBJECTIVE
OF ACHIEVING NEW PROGRESS IN THE INTEGRATION OF THE SUBREGION, THROUGH
NEW MECHANISMS FOR INTEGRATION AND WITH THE CREATION OF THE ANDEAN
PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER WILL BE ENTRUSTED WITH REAFFIRMING COLOMBIA'S
FULL COMMITMENT TO THE INTEGRATION PROCESS AND TO CONCERTED NEW JOINT
ACTIONS WITH PERU, ECUADOR, BOLIVIA, AND VENEZUELA TO FACE THE PROBLEM
OF THE CONSUMPTION, SMUGGLING, AND DRUG PRODUCTION.

   FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I HEREBY REITERATE MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE.  IT IS AT THIS TIME OF
SORROW AND SADNESS WHEN WE COLOMBIANS SHOULD BE MORE UNITED THAN EVER.
I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO USE THE SUFFERING AND THE MEMORIES OF THOSE
WHO HAVE FALLEN AS A FORCE THAT WILL GIVE US MORE COURAGE AND
DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS IN BUILDING COLOMBIA IN PEACE,
FREE OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE.  GOOD NIGHT.
