 COLOMBIAN AND VENEZUELAN
AUTHORITIES ARE FACED WITH A SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY TONIGHT
FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION OF A POWERFUL BOMB PLACED BY GUERRILLAS AT THE
MAIN OIL PIPELINE IN COLOMBIA, CAUSING MORE THAN 15,000 BARRELS OF OIL
TO SPILL AND REACH THE CATATUMBO RIVER ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES.

   REPORTS IN BOGOTA POINT OUT THAT THE OIL SPILL, WHICH IS
APPROXIMATELY 3 KM LONG, IS SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD THE CATATUMBO RIVER,
THREATENING TO REACH VENEZUELA'S MARACAIBO LAKE WITHIN HOURS.

   THE DYNAMITE ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED, ACCORDING TO COLOMBIAN
AUTHORITIES, BY THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN), WHICH IS
CONSIDERED THE MOST RADICAL REBEL GROUP OF THE MANY OPERATING IN THE
COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, MEMBERS OF THAT INSURGENT ORGANIZATION
COMPLETELY BLEW UP A STRETCH OF THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE,
IN AN AREA CLOSE TO TEORAMA IN NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.

   SINCE LAST YEAR THE ELN, WHICH IS HEADED BY SEVERAL FORMER SPANISH
PRIESTS, HAS PERPETRATED OVER 30 ATTACKS AGAINST COLOMBIAN OIL
INSTALLATIONS TO PROTEST THE JOINT EXPLOITATION OF CRUDE BY THE
GOVERNMENT AND MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES.
