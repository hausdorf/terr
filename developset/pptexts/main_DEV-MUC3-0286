THIRTYTHREE SOVIET SEAMEN HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE PERUVIAN PORT OF
CALLAO AS A RESULT OF AN EXPLOSION CAUSED BY A BOMB PLANTED UNDER A
BUS STANDING IN THE STREET.

   OUR CORRESPONDENT TELEPHONED THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY AND
ASKED FOR INFORMATION ON THE INCIDENT.

   "IT HAPPENED ON 5 JULY AT 1010 HOURS LOCAL TIME," S. SVINARENKO, DEPUTY
CHIEF OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF THE FISH INDUSTRY FOREIGN RELATIONS
ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT, SAID.  "SIXTEEN SEAMEN HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED.
FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT.  THE SEAMEN MAINLY SUFFERED
FRACTURES, CUTS, AND BURNS.  THE VICTIMS WERE MEMBERS OF THE CREWS OF TWO
LARGE, AUTONOMOUS TRAWLERS -- THE 'VLADIMIR KURASOV' AND THE 'LAZURNYY' --
WHO WERE ON SHORE LEAVE THAT DAY.

   "OUR SEAMEN ARE WORKING IN THIS REGION ON THE BASIS OF AN AGREEMENT ON
COOPERATION BETWEEN PERU AND THE SOVIET UNION.  WE ASSIST THE PERUVIANS IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR FISHING INDUSTRY, GET OUR SHIPS REPAIRED IN LOCAL
PORTS, AND FISH WITHIN A 200-MILE ZONE OF THAT COUNTRY...."

   REUTER AND AFP HAVE REPORTED THAT, IN THE OPINION OF THE CALLAO POLICE,
THE EXPLOSION WAS ORGANIZED BY THE "SENDERO LUMINOSO," A REBEL GROUP OF
MAOIST PERSUASION.  "THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT THIS ACT, WHICH
DESERVES TO BE CONDEMNED, WAS DIRECTED AGAINST TOTALLY INNOCENT CITIZENS,"
PERUVIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID.

   THE SOVIET SEAMEN WERE ON A BUS WHICH HAD STOPPED AT A STORE WHEN THE
BOMB, PLANTED UNDER AN EMPTY BUS STANDING NEARBY, WAS DETONATED.

   ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES, FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WEARING SCHOOL UNIFORM WERE
SEEN AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THE EXPLOSION,
PLACING A PACKAGE UNDER THE BUS.  

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" IS AN EXTREME LEFT-WING REBEL ORGANIZATION WAGING A
GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  

   "SENDERO LUMINOSO" HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.  IT
BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980.  SINCE THEN, PERU HAS KNOWN NO PEACE.
REPORTS OF MURDERS AND ACTS OF SABOTAGE COMMITTED BY THIS ORGANIZATION ARE
APPEARING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN THE WORLD PRESS.  THE TERRORISTS'
VICTIMS ARE POLITICIANS, MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FORCE, SOLDIERS,
PEASANTS....  THE TERRORISTS OFTEN INVOLVE JUVENILES IN THEIR ACTS OF
SABOTAGE.

   THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORCED TO RELY MORE AND MORE EXTENSIVELY
ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
BUT SO FAR THIS HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE TANGIBLE RESULTS.
