 THE HIGH COMMAND OF
THE ARMED FORCES IS ANALYZING NEWS REPORTS ABOUT COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA
PEREZ, PRESIDENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTION, HAVING SAID THAT THE OFFICER
INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS "FOLLOWED ORDERS
FROM ABOVE".

   OCHOA MADE THOSE COMMENTS ON A U.S. TELEVISION NEWSCAST AT A TIME
WHEN SEVERAL MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS WANT TO CUT AID TO EL
SALVADOR AND ARE CONDUCTING THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CASE.  THE
RESULTS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION WILL BE KNOWN NEXT WEEK.

   DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS CONFIRMED ON THE
MORNING OF 24 APRIL THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS ANALYZING OCHOA'S
DECLARATIONS AND STRESSED THAT VERSIONS SUCH AS THE ONE ATTRIBUTED TO
THE OFFICIAL USUALLY COME FROM "INTERESTED PARTIES."

   LARIOS, QUESTIONED WHEN HE BID FAREWELL TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI, WHO LEFT FOR NICARAGUA ON 24 APRIL, SAID THAT "THE CASE IS
IN THE COURTS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE NEW EVIDENCE MAY APPROACH THEM TO
CONTRIBUTE WHAT THEY HAVE SO THAT IT MAY BE SOLVED."

   "BOTH THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT WANT EVERYTHING TO BE CLARIFIED
WITHIN A FAIR AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK," HE SAID.

   ARMY OFFICERS WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS SAID ON 24 APRIL THAT
"THE COMMENTS MADE BY OCHOA, CONTROVERSIAL POLITICIAN AND SOLDIER
KNOWN FOR HIS FREQUENT OUTBURSTS, HAVE NO BASIS BECAUSE HE HAS NO
ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL ARMED FORCES SOURCES DUE TO HIS RETIRED
STATUS."

   HOWEVER, THE INFORMERS HAVE SAID THAT "WHAT OCHOA SAID NOT ONLY
DAMAGES THE ARMY'S IMAGE, BUT THAT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WHILE IT
CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEFAMATION CAMPAIGN BEING CARRIED OUT ABROAD BY
INTERESTED PARTIES, AMONG THEM, THE LEADERS OF THE FMLN-FDR ."

   THEY ADDED THAT OCHOA'S DECLARATION, "MADE WITHOUT PRESENTING ANY
PROOF, ENDANGERS THE MILITARY AID THAT THE UNITED STATES OFFERS TO EL
SALVADOR AND, AT THE SAME TIME, FAVORS THE INTERNATIONALIST LEFT WHICH
INTENDS TO PLAY THE LAST CARD IT HAS TO ASSAULT POWER IN THIS
COUNTRY."

   THE POLITICIANS' IMMEDIATE REACTION TO OCHOA PEREZ' COMMENTS WAS TO
DEMAND THAT HE BE MORE SPECIFIC IN HIS ACCUSATION.  PDC  LEADER EDUARDO COLINDRES SAID IN A PRESS CONFERENCE
THAT "OCHOA PEREZ HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION OF NAMING" THOSE OF HIS
COMRADES-IN-ARMS HE IMPLICATES IN THE DEATH OF THE JESUITS, SINCE THE
VERSION HE GAVE TO THE TELEVISION PROGRAM THAT INTERVIEWED HIM IS
VAGUE.

   THE POLITICIAN SAID: "IF HE KNOWS SOMETHING, IT IS TIME THAT HE
BRING IT OUT INTO A PUBLIC LIGHT SO THAT JUSTICE AUTHORITIES MAY TAKE
THE APPROPRIATE PATHS."

   MEANWHILE, IN MANAGUA, SPANISH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ATTENDED
VIOLETA CHAMORRO'S INAUGURATION SAID THAT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED BY
THE SLUGGISH MANNER IN WHICH THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE JESUITS' CASE
ARE APPARENTLY BEING CARRIED OUT.  THEY SAID THAT THEY MIGHT MENTION
THE TOPIC DURING THE MEETINGS THEY WILL HOLD WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
IN NICARAGUA.

   REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON D.C. QUOTE THE LEFTIST LEADER OF THE FDR,
GUILLERMO MANUEL UNGO, AS SAYING THAT "HIS EFFORTS IN THE AMERICAN
CAPITAL TO EXPOSE THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, ARE A SUCCESS."

   THE SOURCES SAID THAT UNGO AND HIS MARXIST-LENINIST ALLIES WANT THE
U.S. SENATE TO STOP GIVING MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THE SOURCES
ALSO SAID THAT UNGO DISCREDITS THE ARMY AND THE GOVERNMENT AND FAVORS
THE LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THE REBEL GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   "EVERYTHING SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE LEFTIST INTERNATIONALISTS
HAVE UNLEASHED A NEW DISINFORMATION OFFENSIVE AGAINST EL SALVADOR WITH
THE AID OF BAD SALVADORANS," THE SOURCES SAID.

   REFERRING TO OTHER COMMUNIST MOVES IN THE COUNTRY, GENERAL LARIOS
SAID THAT THE LOCAL LEFTISTS ARE PREPARING TO STAGE TERRORIST ACTIONS
AND STREET DISTURBANCES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF
COMMEMORATING LABOR DAY.

   LARIOS URGED THE FMLN-FDR TERRORISTS TO REFRAIN FROM PERPETRATING
VIOLENT ACTIONS, THUS CREATING AN ADEQUATE CLIMATE FOR THE "DIALOGUE"
ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO BE HELD ON 3 MAY.  "OTHERWISE, THE
TERRORISTS WOULD BE VIOLATING THE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE," LARIOS
POINTED OUT.

   IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM COSTA RICA THAT FMLN-FDR
LEADERS HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE PREPARED ANOTHER OFFENSIVE FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS ELICITED STRONG REJECTION BY
VARIOUS SECTORS.
