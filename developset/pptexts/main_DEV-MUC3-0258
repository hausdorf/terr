 MARY STANISLAUS MAKEIL, A U.S.
NUN, WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED TODAY WHEN SHOTS WERE FIRED AT A VEHICLE IN
WHICH SHE WAS TRAVELING NEAR ZARAGOZA, 20 KM SOUTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL
CITY, CHURCH SOURCES HAVE REPORTED.

   MAKEIL WAS TRAVELING WITH TWO OTHER NUNS OF THE ORDER OF THE CHARITY OF
THE INCARNATE WORD IN A PRIVATE VEHICLE ALONG THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN SAN
SALVADOR AND ZARAGOZA, WHEN UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANTS IN ANOTHER VEHICLE
OPENED FIRE.  JUANA MARGARITA FLORES, ONE OF THE NUNS TRAVELING WITH MAKEIL,
EXPLAINED THAT ONE OF THE BULLETS HIT MAKEIL NEAR THE RIGHT EAR.

   AFTER THE INCIDENT, THE NUNS TOOK MAKEIL TO SAN RAFAEL HOSPITAL IN SANTA
TECLA.  HOWEVER, DUE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF HER CONDITION, SHE WAS
TRANSPORTED OVERNIGHT TO A PRIVATE HOSPITAL IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL CITY,
WHERE SHE WILL UNDERGO EMERGENCY SURGERY.  

   THE THREE NUNS WORK AT THE OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO COMMUNITY (COAR), WHICH
TAKES CARE OF WAR ORPHANS.  IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT IN 1980, FOUR U.S.
NUNS WHO WERE TRAVELING FROM THE COMALAPA AIRPORT TO SAN SALVADOR WERE
KILLED BY SALVADORAN NATIONAL GUARDSMEN.
