  MONTENEGRO, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
IF THE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT  WILL
CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER
SINCE THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WAS SIGNED?

    THE TRUTH IS THAT THE REASONS WHY THE FMLN BEGAN ITS
OFFENSIVE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1989 HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL.  THUS, THE FMLN
CANNOT STOP ITS OFFENSIVE.  ON THE CONTRARY, WHAT HAPPENED IN EL
SALVADOR IS THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE STRATEGICALLY TURNED THE WAR.
THAT TURN INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND DIPLOMATIC
IMPLICATIONS.

   THUS, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN SAN ISIDRO DE
CORONADO DID NOT PROPOSE REALISTIC NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CONFLICT.
YESTERDAY, 12 DECEMBER, THE FMLN ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE WHICH VEHEMENTLY
EXPRESSED ITS ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE
PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.  AT PRESENT, THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT DESPITE WHAT
THE OTHER FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAY, IT IS CLEARER THAN
EVER THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A FASCIST, MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES PEOPLE'S HUMAN
RIGHTS AND THAT FACT HAS BEEN CLEARLY PROVED TO THE ENTIRE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, ANY ATTEMPT TO HELP THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OR ANY KIND OF SUPPORT GIVEN TO IT NOTHING BUT A
PIECE OF PAPER THAT DOES NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VALIDITY TO THE FMLN.

    IN OTHER WORDS COMRADE, THE FMLN WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME
LEVEL OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE DICTATORSHIP?

    I BELIEVE THE FMLN'S ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW MORE
LEGITIMATE THAN EVER.  THE SUMMIT CONFIRMED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE
FMLN'S STRUGGLE, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM THAT SUMMIT IS
NEITHER FEASIBLE NOR REAL.  THE FMLN WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE ITS
POLITICAL - MILITARY OFFENSIVE.  THE FMLN WILL INCREASE ITS ACTIONS.
THE FMLN IS REORGANIZING  ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY
APPARATUS.  IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL CLEARLY SHOW WHAT THE FMLN
CAN DO.  THE FMLN WILL NOT SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY NOW.  THE
FMLN HAS NO OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT
THE SALVADORAN REALITY AT ALL.

   IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CHOSE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES TO
WHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS REALLY THEIR PROBLEM.

    TWO DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT,
WHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?

    AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER IN ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION,
THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE FMLN DEFINATELY CHANGED THE WAR.  THIS
MEANS THAT THE FMLN MADE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES RETREAT FROM THE
MOUNTAINS TO THE HEART OF THE CITIES INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   AT PRESENT, WE HAVE ALMOST ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE HIGHWAYS IN
14, I MEAN 12 SALVADORAN DEPARTMENTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ACTIONS IN
AHUACHAPAN AND SONSONATE, TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD BEEN ALMOST
UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR.

   THERE IS A STRATEGIC SIEGE IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS 65
PERCENT OF ITS FORCES STATIONED IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS
ABANDONED LARGE AREAS.

   AS FOR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, AT PRESENT THERE ARE 10 110,000-VOLT
PRIMARY LINES THAT ARE OUT OF SERVICE.  THAT REPRESENTS A 40-PERCENT
ENERGY DEFICIT IN THE COUNTRY.  THERE HAVE BEEN LONG PERIODS OF
100-PERCENT POWER OUTAGES IN SAN SALVADOR.  IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT
THE GOVERNMENT CAN CONTROL THAT SITUATION.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG
THEY WILL ENDURE IT.  BUT IN ANY CASE, A STRONG BLOW BY THE FMLN
FORCES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR SOMEWHERE IN EL SALVADOR AT ANY TIME.
