 THE
SALVADORAN OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS
TODAY PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A SALVATION JUNTA THAT WOULD INCLUDE
THE ARMY AND THE FMLN ,
HUMBERTO CENTENO -- LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION NATIONAL UNION OF
SALVADORAN WORKERS  -- HAS ANNOUNCED.  IN STATEMENTS TO IPS,
CENTENO SAID THE FMLN HAS ALREADY SAID IT IS WILLING TO JOIN THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE, AND THAT IT IS WILLING TO BE A PART OF A
SALVATION JUNTA AS A SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CRISIS.

   THE UNTS' PROPOSAL WAS SUPPORTED BY FIDEL CHAVEZ MENA, CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY  NATIONAL SECRETARY AND PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION, IN STATEMENTS TO THE
PRESS.  CHAVEZ MENA, WHO WAS THE PDC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE
PAST ELECTIONS, SAID THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO SOLVE THE CIVIL WAR
PROBLEM WOULD BE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RECTIFY ITS STAND AND INITIATE
NEW NEGOTIATIONS.  WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN TO FIND A SOLUTION, HE TOLD
NEWSMEN, ADDING THAT NEITHER SIDE WILL ACHIEVE A MILITARY VICTORY.

   MEANWHILE, CENTENO STATED THAT THE BOMBINGS IN DENSELY POPULATED
AREAS AND THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS ARE FACTORS THAT ARE
WEARING OUT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.
ACCORDING TO THE LABOR LEADER, NONE OF THE SOCIAL FORCES WITH ANY
REPRESENTATIVE FORCE SUPPORT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS GOVERNMENT.

   ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT A GENERAL CONSENSUS, THE POLITICAL AND LABOR
GROUPS HAVE SAID THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND THE
RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE OAS AND THE UNITED
NATIONS AS WELL AS THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AS GUARANTORS OF
THE AGREEMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE PETITION MIGHT NOT BE RECEIVED WELL BY A
GOVERNMENT THAT IS APPARENTLY NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE
WITH THE REBELS WHO CONTINUE OCCUPYING THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE
NORTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL CITY.
