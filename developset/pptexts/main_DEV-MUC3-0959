 MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS,
ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT "THE UNITED STATES SAYS
THAT IT WANTS TO HELP IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL
SALVADOR. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF
THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IT IS OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE."

   ARCHBISHOP RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, "I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF
ASSUMING THIS ATTITUDE IS.  HOWEVER, WHEN EYEWITNESS LUCIA BARRERA DE
CERNA FIRST TESTIFIED, SHE CLEARLY DESCRIBED THE MEN AS BEING DRESSED
AS SOLDIERS AND NOT AS GUERRILLAS. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS EASY TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ONE WAY OF DRESSING AND ANOTHER."

   IT SEEMS THAT THE PLAN IS TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATION THROUGH OTHER
PATHS, AND THAT IS WHY THE U.S. OFFICIALS TOOK THE EYEWITNESS TO THE
UNITED STATES, "WHERE SHE WAS GIVEN AN AUTHENTIC BRAINWASHING AND
THREATENED WITH DEPORTATION IF SHE DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH."

   ACCORDING TO THE JESUITS' LAWYER, SCOTT GRATHEAD, MRS. CERNA WAS
SUBJECTED TO AN "AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT" QUESTIONING SESSION.  AFTER
THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORMENT, SHE THOUGHT IT OVER AND RETRACTED HER
STATEMENT.  FORTUNATELY, ONCE RID OF THE PRESSURE FROM HER
"PROTECTORS," SHE HAS RETAKEN THE PATH OF TRUTH.

   IN HIS HOMILY TODAY, THE ARCHBISHOP DENOUNCED THE UNITED STATES FOR
TREATING THE WITNESS DIFFERENTLY ONCE SHE ARRIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES, INSTEAD OF PROTECTING HER LIKE THE U.S.  EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN
SAN SALVADOR HAD PROMISED, KNOWING THAT THE HUMBLE WORKING WOMAN
"FREELY AND SINCERELY HAD DECLARED WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD THE
NIGHT OF THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE."  THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE MURDERED ON
THE MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER.

   REFERRING TO THE STATEMENT MADE BY THE NATION'S ATTORNEY GENERAL,
WHO SAID THAT THE CHURCH HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS -- A LAWYER-PRIEST
HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION -- THE
ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT THIS STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY FALSE BUT ALSO
MALICIOUS.

   IN HIS HOMILY TODAY THE PRELATE SAID THAT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT
THE LAYMEN'S GROUND, AND THAT IS WHERE THEY SHOULD PROVE THEIR
EXPERTISE AND MORAL INTEGRITY. THEY SHOULD IMBUE THE EXERCISE OF THEIR
PROFESSION WITH EVANGELICAL VALUES.

   THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT, IN THE SECOND PLACE, "IT COULD BE A
TRAP."  HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH IS NOT GOING TO ENDORSE WITH A
CLERGYMAN'S PRESENCE SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE
"MURKY."

   THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS LINKED TO THE INVESTIGATION IN AN
INDEPENDENT WAY HAVE BEEN DISTRUSTFUL EVER SINCE THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL'S OFFICE SHOWED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD LUCIA BARRERA DE CERNA'S
TESTIMONY.  SHE WAS TESTIFYING AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY BEFORE LAWYERS
AND AMBASSADORS, AND AS THE CURFEW HOUR APPROACHED, THEY TOOK THE
WITNESS TO ANOTHER EMBASSY.  THE NEXT DAY TWO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS CAME
TO HARASS THE WITNESS WITH QUESTIONS.

   THE ARCHBISHOP ONCE AGAIN REJECTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
ACCUSATION.  HE REITERATED THE BELIEF THAT THE ARMED FORCES WERE
GUILTY OF THE MURDERS.  HE SAID, "I AM NOT MAKING ANY ACCUSATIONS.
HOWEVER, THE CHURCH IS VERY ANNOYED, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SAYING THAT
WE ARE THE OBJECT OF OFFICIAL PERSECUTION, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THIS REGIME THERE IS PERSECUTION IN OTHER SECTORS."
