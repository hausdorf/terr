CONCERNING A LAST-MINUTE REPORT WHICH INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES ARE
ATTRIBUTING TO A CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN
OPERATION CONCERNING ATTACKS AGAINST SEVERAL MILITARY GARRISONS IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WE INTERVIEWED COLONEL MAURICIO ERNESTO
VARGAS, COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE STATIONED IN SAN
MIGUEL.  WE CONTACTED HIM BY TELEPHONE, AS FOLLOWS:

     COLONEL, IS IT TRUE THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL
OR NATIONAL OPERATION TO ATTACK THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE?

    I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL OR NATIONAL
OPERATION.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT THESE ARE TREACHEROUS, COWARDLY ACTIONS,
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF CONFRONTING THE SOLDIERS, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE
MILITARY UNITS.  IN SAN MIGUEL, THERE WERE FIVE EXPLOSIONS IN OPEN AREAS
ABOUT 2 TO 3 KM APART.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE
INFLICTED ON THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE OR ITS INSTALLATIONS.  THEY HIT SOME
FUEL TANKS FILLED WITH ABOUT 3,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE, WHICH STARTED A
FIRE.  HOWEVER, THE FIRES WERE IN OPEN AREAS, SO THERE HAVE BEEN NO
CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE TO THE INSTALLATIONS.

    THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT  CLAIMS IT
SEIZED EL SALITRE ESTATE AND, FROM THERE, ATTACKED THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE.

    EL SALITRE ESTATE WAS NOT OCCUPIED.  AN OLD SHACK ON THE ESTATE
WAS SET ABLAZE, BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTROLLED THE FIRE.  I THINK THESE
ARE THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY VICTORIES THE FMLN TALKS ABOUT: ATTACKS AGAINST
FIXED INSTALLATIONS THAT CONTAIN NO MILITARY UNITS, WHERE NOT EVEN PEASANTS
ARE SLEEPING AT THE TIME.  I BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THE FMLN SAYS IT FIGHTS
HEROICALLY FOR 4 HOURS TO BURN SEVEN PATCHES OF CROPS AND HOW IT CLAIMS IT
HEROICALLY FIGHTS TO DOWN POWER TOWERS, WHICH ARE UNMOVING OBJECTS.  THESE
ARE THE ONLY GREAT ACTIONS IT CARRIES OUT, BUT THESE ACTIONS ARE AGAINST
FIXED TARGETS THAT CANNOT MOVE.  I REPEAT, THESE ARE COWARDLY ACTIONS THAT
DO NOT CONFRONT THE SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE MILITARY ABILITIES OF THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY.

    DO YOU HAVE ANY UNITS COMBING THE AREA?  

    YES, DEFINITELY, WE HAVE MEN IN THE AREA.  THE TRUTH IS THAT
AT 0200 TODAY, UNITS WERE BEING MOBILIZED.  AS I SAID, THESE ARE COWARDLY
ACTIONS, CARRIED OUT IN THE DARK, AND THE FMLN FLEES WHEN IT SEES OUR
WELL-TRAINED MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORM.  THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

    YOU HAVE PERMANENT GUARDS FOR SAN MIGUEL.  SOME OF THE MARKET
VENDORS TOLD US FOR THE FIRST TIME, NOT A SINGLE SHOT WAS HEARD.

    YES, THAT IS RIGHT.  AS I SAID, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ATTACKS
OR HARASSMENT, JUST FIVE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY
CHANGES IN THE CORRELATION OF MILITARY FORCES.  THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL
SHOULD BE CALM; WE WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH SECURITY.  THE PEOPLE OF THE
EASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CALM, BECAUSE WE WILL INCREASE OUR
ABILITIES AND EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL THE SECURITY POSSIBLE.  THE
FMLN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR BEING SO AUDACIOUS.

    THE FMLN SAID IT WAS FIGHTING IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  

    WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ACTION IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  WE
HAVE REPORTS THAT IN SAN ILDEFONSO, SAN VICENTE DEPARTMENT -- SOUTH OF
CABANAS -- THERE WERE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE NATIONAL GUARD -- WHICH WE
SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY -- REPORTED SOME CATAPULTS HAD
BEEN FIRED.  HOWEVER, NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED, AND I HAVE NO REPORTS OF ANY
ACTION IN OTHER PLACES.

    TODAY IS MOTHER'S DAY.  

    YES, DEFINITELY, GREETINGS TO ALL MOTHERS:  HAVE FAITH AND
HOPE THAT YOUR SONS ARE HERE -- FROM THE GENERAL TO THE LAST SOLDIER --
AND THEY LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND ARE WORKING FOR YOU, SO YOU WILL HAVE THE
PEACE AND TRANQUILITY YOU NEED AS MOTHERS TO GENERATE LOVE AND COURAGE FOR
EACH OF YOUR SONS.  ON BEHALF OF ALL YOUR SONS, THE SOLDIERS, TO ALL
MOTHERS OF THE EASTERN AREA AND OF EL SALVADOR: RECEIVE LOVE AND KISSES.
