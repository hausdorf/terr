MINISTER JAIME DE LA SOTTA AND FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE
ERRAZURIZ WILL LEAVE TONIGHT FOR THE UNITED STATES IN AN ATTEMPT TO
ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  THEY WILL
TAKE LAN-CHILE FLIGHT 141 THAT DEPARTS AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 FROM
SANTIAGO AND GOES DIRECTLY TO NEW YORK.

   IN NEW YORK, THE TWO MINISTERS WILL TAKE ANOTHER PLANE TO WASHINGTON AND
WILL ARRIVE AT APPROXIMATELY NOON TOMORROW. IN THE U.S. CAPITAL THEY WILL
MEET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

   THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON
IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE BAN OVER AN UNUSUAL
TELEVISION NETWORK FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY THAT SOME CHILEAN GRAPES WERE
LACED CYANIDE.  DE LA SOTTA STATED THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DAMAGE
THAT TERRORISM CAN CAUSE.

     YOU CAN SEE AND MEASURE THE SCOPE OF A
TERRORIST ACT SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED, THE SOLE OBJECTIVE
OF WHICH IS TO CAUSE HARM. THIS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY THE ADVERTISEMENT,
NOT A CLEAR AND CONCRETE ADVERTISEMENT, BUT AN ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL BY
WHICH THEY WARNED US, THAT IS, THEY WARNED THE EMBASSIES THEY CALLED, THAT
THEY WOULD CARRY OUT SUCH AN ACT.  THIS CALL WAS MADE 3 DAYS AFTER THE
DEPARTURE OF THE FRUIT SHIPMENT.  WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION TO
THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, FOLLOWING TECHNICAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF
SAMPLES TAKEN.  THEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL, THAT
IT WAS AN ANOMYOUS CALL AND AS SUCH COULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  LATER, IN
THE SHIPMENTS THAT ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST WEEKEND, THE PRESENCE
OF CYANIDE WAS DETECTED IN TWO GRAPES.  

   DE LA SOTTA ADDED THAT ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO OVERCOME THE
IMPASSE.  THE MAJOR PROBLEM NOW INVOLVES THE 17 MILLION BOXES THAT ARRIVED
AT THEIR PORTS OF DESTINATION READY FOR DISTRIBUTION.  NOW NO ONE KNOWS WHAT
TO DO WITH THEM.  THERE ARE 7 OR 8 MILLION BOXES MORE BEING SHIPPED TO THE
SAME PORTS, AND 3 MILLION BOXES REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY, READY TO BE SHIPPED.
DE LA SOTTA SAID THAT THE CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN TWO SINGLE GRAPES.

     THE ESSENTIAL THING, I BELIEVE, IS  THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN ADOPT MEASURES.  WE WILL TALK WITH
THE HEALTH OFFICIALS TO GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY ASSURANCES SO THEY CAN LIFT
THE BAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  

   IN ORDER TO FACE THE PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED THREE COMISSIONS
TO STUDY THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM, THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER
STATED.
