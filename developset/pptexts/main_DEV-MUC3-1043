 A MILITARY SOURCE,
QUOTING INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS HAVE ABANDONED THEIR STRICTLY MILITARY GOALS TO INSTEAD
DIRECT THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST ECONOMIC TARGETS, WITHIN THEIR USUAL
PATTERN OF WEARING DOWN THE ECONOMY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE CHANGE IN TACTICS TO THE "FAILURE" OF THE
OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) ON 11 NOVEMBER, IN WHICH SIX GUERRILLA COMMANDERS AND ALL
GUERRILLA TROOPS TOOK PART.

   ACCORDING TO THE FMLN, THE OFFENSIVE'S GOAL WAS TO NEGOTIATE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT ON A "ONE-TO-ONE" BASIS.  IN THE OPINION OF THE ARMY,
HOWEVER, THE FMLN WAS TRYING TO CAUSE AN INSURRECTION AMONG THE PEOPLE
TO GRAB POWER.

   THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT FOLLOWING
THE OFFENSIVE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO "READAPT" THEIR MILITARY CADRES TO
THE TRADITIONAL "PROLONGED PEOPLE'S WAR."

   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE BELIEVES THAT WITH THIS CHANGE IN TACTICS,
THE GUERRILLAS ARE TRYING TO "MAINTAIN THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE AND
THUS RAISE THE FIGHTERS MORALE FOLLOWING THE DISBANDING OF IMPORTANT
MILITARY CADRES."

   FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF THE UNILATERAL TRUCE DECREED BY THE
FMLN BETWEEN 23 DECEMBER AND 2 JANUARY, THE GUERRILLAS RESTARTED THEIR
ACTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY BY BLOWING-UP THE COUNTRY'S
POWER GRID AND SHOPS IN SAN SALVADOR.

   ECONOMIC LOSSES LAST YEAR DUE TO GUERRILLA SABOTAGE TO THE
TRANSPORT, POWER AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURES
SURPASSED $100 MILLION, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SOURCES.

   THE SOURCE SAID THAT THE MILITARY RESTRUCTURE ENCOMPASSED THE SIX
ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPRISE THE FMLN: THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY OF
CENTRAL AMERICAN WORKERS (PRTC), THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE (RN), THE
SALVADORAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCS), THE POPULAR LIBERATION FORCES (FPL),
THE ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION (FAL), AND THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY
ARMY (ERP).

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, THE PRTC, RN, AND THE PCS NOW
OPERATE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIES OF THE COUNTRY,
WHILE THE FPL OPERATES IN THE CENTRAL REGION, THE ERP IN THE
NORTHEAST, AND THE FAL IN THE SOUTHEAST.
