 1. WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE PATRIOTIC
INVITATION INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY MONSIGNOR MARIO REVOLLO
BRAVO AND BY THE DISTINGUISHED FORMER PRESIDENTS ALFONSO LOPEZ, JULIO
CESAR TURBAY, AND MISAEL PASTRANA AS WELL AS BY PATRIOTIC UNION
PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR.

   2.  TO RESPOND TO SUCH PROPOSALS, WE REITERATE OUR WELL-KNOWN PEACE
COMMITMENTS EXPRESSED IN OUR MOST SINCERE AND FRANK STATEMENTS.

   3.  WE FULLY SHARE THE CRITERIA EXPRESSED BY THEM REGARDING THE
SURVIVAL OF THE STATE AND GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS DEMOCRATICALLY
ELECTED, AGAINST ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE LIKE US, WHO HAVE SHOWN NO
REGARD FOR THE LAW BY FIGHTING INSTITUTIONS AND THE LEGALLY
ESTABLISHED ORDER.

   4.  AFTER EVALUATING OUR CONDUCT UNDER THE PREVIOUS CONCEPT, WE ARE
ONLY INTERESTED IN PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND DEMOCRACY FOR OUR
FATHERLAND AND FOR OUR PEOPLE.

   5.  AS A RESULT, WE ACCEPT THE VICTORY OF THE STATE, THE
INSTITUTIONS, AND THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL LAY
DOWN OUR WEAPONS AND OTHER MEANS OF STRUGGLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE
COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS.

   6.  WE ACCEPT THE LEGAL ORDER THAT IS CURRENTLY IN FORCE WITH THE
HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY WILL RESPECT OUR RIGHTS AND WILL
ALLOW US TO RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.

   7.  AS AN ABSOLUTE PROOF OF OUR INTEREST IN ACHIEVING PEACE, WE
HAVE DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY RELEASE MRS PATRICIA ECHAVARRIA AND HER
DAUGHTER AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE AS
CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT.  WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE CASES OF KIDNAPPED PEOPLE OF WHICH WE ARE
ACCUSED.

   8.  WE OFFER OUR SERVICES AS MEDIATORS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITH THE
EMERALD TRAFFICKERS, THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS, AND THE
SO-CALLED HIRED ASSASSINS WITH THE ONLY PURPOSE OF ENDING THE VIOLENCE
THAT IS HURTING OUR COLOMBIAN FATHERLAND.

   9.  WE HAVE DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE SHIPMENT OF DRUGS AND TO TURN IN
OUR WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, LABORATORIES, CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIPS, AND
OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR ACTIVITIES AS SOON AS WE GET
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GUARANTEES.

   10.  THERE WILL BE NO MORE BOMBINGS ANYWHERE ON NATIONAL TERRITORY
AND WE HAVE ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL TYPES OF EXECUTIONS OF
POLITICAL LEADERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ASSOCIATION LEADERS, JUDICIAL
OFFICIALS, JOURNALISTS, POLICEMEN, AND SOLDIERS.

   11.  THE ESSENTIAL REASON FOR OUR STRUGGLE HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS
BE OUR FAMILIES, OUR FREEDOM, OUR PEOPLE, OUR LIVES, AND OUR RIGHTS AS
CITIZENS OF THIS FATHERLAND.

   THE EXTRADITABLES, 16 JANUARY 1990
