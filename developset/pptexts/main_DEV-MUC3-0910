 VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ REFERRED TODAY TO THE MURDER OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN IN
SAN SALVADOR AND SAID THAT "THERE IS A GENERALIZED SUSPICION THAT NO ONE CAN
HIDE, AND IT IS THAT THE EXTREME RIGHT AND NOT THE EXTREME LEFT COMMITTED
THESE MURDERS."

   PEREZ, WHO EXPRESSED HIS VIEWPOINTS ABOUT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION
DURING HIS NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE MIRAFLORES PALACE, SAID THAT IT IS
VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE CRIMES BE INVESTIGATED AND THAT THE
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BE PUNISHED.  HE ADDED THAT HE HAS TELEPHONED
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH
AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS.

   THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THE
EVIDENCE POINTS IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE AUTHORS OF THE CRIMES
COMMITTED ON 16 NOVEMBER, "WE CANNOT TAKE ANY SIDES IN THIS ISSUE,
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION, AND THAT IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE."

   CONCERNING THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO SUSPEND COOPERATION
WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, PEREZ POINTED OUT
THAT THIS ACTION IS ONE WAY OF MAINTAINING AN ACTIVE NEUTRALITY.

   ACCORDING TO THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, THE SPANISH STAND IS ONE OF
COOPERATION SO THAT THERE WILL BE PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING IN CENTRAL
AMERICA, BECAUSE IT IS WITHDRAWING THE AID AS LONG AS IT IS UNCLEAR
HOW SERIOUS THE CONFLICTING PARTIES ARE ABOUT REACHING AN AGREEMENT.
