 THE BODIES
OF THE SPANISH JESUITS MURDERED LAST FRIDAY  BY UNIFORMED
INDIVIDUALS WERE BURIED IN SAN SALVADOR TODAY.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT
HAS ASKED THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FOR EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THESE
DEATHS.  TODAY IN PARIS THE SPANISH PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT FUTURE
CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI DEPENDS ON THE
RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION:

     THE GREATEST POSSIBLE EFFORT SHOULD BE
MADE IMMEDIATELY TO INVESTIGATE WHAT HAPPENED REGARDING MURDERS WHICH
SOME PEOPLE ARE APPARENTLY INTERPRETING IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT
THEY ARE SPANISH, OR SPANISH CITIZENS WHO TOOK ON SALVADORAN
CITIZENSHIP, BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE CITIZENS WHO
SUFFERED THIS APPALLING ATTACK, THIS MURDER, WERE SPANISH.  OUR
CONCERN OBVIOUSLY IS NOT EXPRESSED MERELY IN TERMS OF THIS OR THAT
NATIONALITY BECAUSE THIS MURDER IS A HIDEOUS CRIME AND THUS THE MATTER
MUST BE CLEARED UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND FURTHERMORE MUCH OF THE
EFFORT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF  WITH REGARD
TO THAT COUNTRY DEPENDS UPON IT.  

   A SPANISH DIPLOMATIC DELEGATION HEADED BY UNDERSECRETARY FOR
FOREIGN AFFAIRS INOCENCIO ARIAS ATTENDED THE BURIAL OF THE JESUITS.
HE PUT HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SPANISH RESIDENTS IN EL SALVADOR
WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND RETURN TO SPAIN.
