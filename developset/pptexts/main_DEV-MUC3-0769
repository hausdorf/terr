 THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX MEMBERS OF HIS ORDER, INCLUDING IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UCA), "ARE THE SAME ONES WHO
KILLED MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR."

   "I DO NOT WANT TO ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS WHERE THE FACTS ARE
POINTING," JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA  STATED AT A
NEWS CONFERENCE HELD THIS AFTERNOON IN THE UCA CHAPEL, ONLY A FEW METERS
FROM WHERE THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTICS WERE KILLED THIS MORNING.

   THE BODIES OF ELLACURIA AND HIS JESUIT COMPANIONS IGNACIO MARTIN
BARO, SEGUNDO MONTES, JUAN RAMON MORENO, ARMANDO LOPEZ, AND JOAQUIN
LOPEZ, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC ELBA RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
WERE RIDDLED WITH BULLETS, WHILE SOME ALSO HAD THEIR SKILLS CRUSHED.

   THE DEATH OF THE PRIESTS, FIVE OF THEM SPANIARDS, WHO WERE ALWAYS
IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, HAS INCREASED THE
FEAR AND DESPERATION FELT BY THE SALVADORANS SINCE THE PAST WEEKEND,
WHEN VIOLENT FIGHTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND SOLDIERS IN
THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE PRIESTS WERE KILLED BY SOME 30 MEN WEARING OLIVE DRAB UNIFORMS
WHO BROKE INTO THE PLACE, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES WHO WERE THERE,
TOJEIRA EXPLAINED.

   THE PRIEST RECALLED THAT OVER THE WEEKEND THE GOVERNMENT RADIO
NETWORK "LAUNCHED FIERCE ATTACKS AGAINST THE , SAYING
THAT A FEW PRIESTS HAD TO BE KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY OR THAT THEY HAD
TO BE PLACED IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL SO THAT THE PEOPLE COULD KILL
THEM BY SPITTING AT THEM," TOJERA NOTED.

   ALSO, HE ADDED THAT ON MONDAY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS RAIDED THE HOMES
OF ELLACURIA AND COMPANIONS.  "ON THAT OCCASION THEY WERE QUITE
CORRECT, ACCORDING TO WHAT FATHER ELLACURIA TOLD ME," ADDED TOJEIRA,
WHO WAS QUITE UPSET DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE.

   "APPARENTLY THE MEN SAID THEY HAD REPORTS THAT THERE WERE WEAPONS
IN THE RESIDENCES.  OF COURSE THEY FOUND NOTHING, AND FATHER ELLACURIA
INVITED THEM TO RETURN ON TUESDAY AND GO THROUGH THE UCA CAMPUS, BUT
THEY DID NOT DO SO."

   ALSO, TOJEIRA CONFIRMED THAT ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING
THERE WAS TIGHT SECURITY IN THE VICINITY OF THE UCA IN THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE CAPITAL.

   "I DO NOT KNOW IF THE SOLDIERS LEFT THE PLACE LATER, BUT UP UNTIL
2200 ON WEDNESDAY, HOURS BEFORE THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE, THE SOLDIERS
WERE THERE," TOJEIRA ADDED.

   "THESE ARE THE FACTS.  THEREFORE, WE SHARE THE OPINION OF
ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA -- THAT THE ONES RESPONSIBLE ARE THE SAME
ONES WHO ASSASSINATED MSGR ROMERO," HE ADDED.
