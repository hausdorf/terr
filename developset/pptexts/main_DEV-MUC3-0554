 TODAY PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM
SAID THAT HE IS WILLING TO ACCEPT "ALL THE POLITICAL COSTS THAT MAY
EMERGE" FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON TO MILITARY MEN AND CIVILIANS WHO
VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE PARDON WAS ORDERED WITH THE SIGNING OF
SEVERAL DECREES TODAY.

   MENEM TALKED WITH REPORTERS ABOUT THE PARDON.  HE SAID: "I CANNOT
ESTIMATE WHAT THE POLITICAL COSTS WILL BE.  I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY
WILL BE MANY OR NOT BUT I WILL ASSUME MY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COSTS.
WHAT INTERESTS ME IS MY COUNTRY, MY PEOPLE."

   MENEM ADDED: "ACQUITTAL MEANS PARDON, AND FROM NOW ON ALL THOSE WHO
RECENTLY VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN PARDONED."

   MENEM SAID THAT IT IS "BASICALLY" IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US "TO BE
ABLE TO BUILD AN ARGENTINA WHERE IT WILL BE WORTH LIVING."  REGARDING
THOSE PARDONED, MENEM SAID THAT HE WISHED THEM WELL AND THAT "THEY
SHOULD WORK IN PEACE HERE IN ARGENTINA OR ANYWHERE ELSE."

   HE INDICATED THAT HE IS WILLING "WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS TO MEET WITH
THEM" BECAUSE "IF THE PRESIDENT PARDONED THEM IN THE NAME OF WHAT HE
REPRESENTS AND IF IN SOME WAY HE REPRESENTS THE LAW AND A LARGE SECTOR
OF THE COMMUNITY, THEN I AM WILLING TO TALK WITH ANYONE WHO WANTS."


   HE DENIED HAVING BEEN PRESSURED TO IMPLEMENT THE PARDON QUICKLY
"EITHER BY THE ARMED FORCES OR CIVILIANS."  HE POINTED OUT THAT "THERE
IS A MAN WHO DID NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON; HE IS
ADMIRAL ARMANDO LAMBRUSCHINI WHOSE 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED
BY A BOMB.  THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
WHEM MEASURES OF THIS TYPE ARE IMPLEMENTED."

   MENEM CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT "THIS MEASURE WHICH I TAKE UNDER MY
RESPONSIBILITY HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE JUSTICIALIST PARTY AND OTHER
PARTIES IN ADDITION TO A VERY IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
AND OTHER RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS."
