   THE
GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE HAS NOT BEEN DEFEATED AND CANNOT BE DEFEATED.
INTERNATIONAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE
BECOME STRONG IN THE CITY, THAT THEY ARE MAKING TACTICAL MOVEMENTS,
AND THAT IN SPITE OF THE BARBARISM WITH WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAS
BEEN OPERATING, THE GUERRILLAS MAINTAIN ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONAL
CAPABILITIES.

   THE SITUATION CANNOT DEFEAT US.  THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION, AND THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY, AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS, BECOMING
INVOLVED IN THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS TO DEFEAT THE FASCISTS AND THE
GENOCIDAL TACTICS THEY ARE USING.

   WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION, AND THIS UNDOUBTEDLY WILL HAVE AN EFFECT
ON THE ARMED FORCES AND COULD RESULT IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE
INSTITUTION.

   WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE ARMED FORCES THERE ARE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS
WHO REJECT FASCISM.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DESERTIONS IN THE ARMY
FILES.  MANY ORDERS ARE BEING DISOBEYED, ORDERS OF A GENOCIDAL NATURE
USUALLY.  THIS IS THE STARTING POINT OF AN EVENT THAT WILL STUN
POLITICAL OPINION IN EL SALVADOR.

   WE BELIEVE THAT IF THIS SAVAGE KILLING OF PEOPLE DOES NOT STOP, THE
MILITARY INSTITUTION WILL BE SIGNING ITS OWN DEATH SENTENCE.  THE
PEOPLE CANNOT TOLERATE A MILITARY THAT FUNCTIONS UNDER A MOST SAVAGE
AND DESPOTIC REGIME, AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS IN HOT WATER, WE
COULD SAY.

   THE REVOLUTIONARY OFFENSIVE, AS I HAVE NOTED, IS BEING DEVELOPED.
WE HAVE SOLID POSITIONS IN FOUR OF EL SALVADOR'S MAIN CITIES, AND AS
WE HAVE SAID BEFORE: NO ONE IS GOING TO PUSH US OUT.  VICTORY FOR
DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN ASSURED.  THE WORLD WILL BACK US IN THE FACE OF THE
SAVAGE GENOCIDE BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES, ESPECIALLY BY THE FASCIST
MILITARY ELEMENTS IN EL SALVADOR.

    TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER, THE FUNERAL RITES FOR THE THE
PRIESTS WHO WERE MURDERED IN SAN SALVADOR ARE TAKING PLACE AT THIS
MOMENT, AROUND NOON TIME, AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS WIFE ARE
ATTENDING THIS CEREMONY.  DO YOU HAVE ANY MESSAGE FOR THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE, FOR THE STUDENTS FROM THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY, FOR THE
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL, WHO ARE MOURNING THE
DEATH OF THESE WORTHY JESUITS?

    WE HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED, AND I WILL REITERATE IT NOW, THE
DEEP SORROW OF THE FMLN MILITANTS AND THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL OVER THE
LOSS OF THESE WORTHY JESUIT PRIESTS WHO HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT
STRUGGLERS FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  WE SHARE THE
FEELINGS OF THE SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY.

   I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PRESENCE OF CRISTIANI AT THE BURIAL
FOR THE JESUIT PRIESTS CALLS FOR A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY
IN DEMAND FOR PUNISHMENT FOR THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ATROCIOUS ASSASSINATION.

   CRISTIANI CANNOT GO TO THAT BURIAL AND DO NOTHING ABOUT PEOPLE TO
WHOM HE OPENED DOORS SO THAT THEY COULD COMMIT THESE KILLINGS.
EVERYBODY MUST DEMAND THAT CRISTIANI RESPOND TO THE PEOPLE'S
INDIGNATION BY PUNISHING THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME.
CRISTIANI CANNOT SPEAK ABOUT HAVING MORAL AUTHORITY FOR ATTENDING THAT
BURIAL UNLESS HE PUNISHES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE.  IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO PUNISH THE ASSASSINS.  THERE MUST BE A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION OF THE WAVE OF CRIME THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED IN EL
SALVADOR.  THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS, BUT IN THE PAST 8 DAYS MANY COMMON PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY
LEADERS HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED.  THE BOMBING HAS BEEN INTENSE.  THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE ENDURING MUCH PAIN AND THEY DEMAND THAT THE
PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BE PUNISHED.

   WE AGAIN REITERATE THE PAIN OF THE PEOPLE OVER THE DEATH OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH MUST BRAVELY AND
LOUDLY DEMAND JUSTICE IN THE FACE OF THESE CRIMES.
