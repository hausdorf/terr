 ATTENTION. PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION.  ATTENTION.  PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.  AS WE HAVE ALREADY
REPORTED, U.S.  OFFICIALS, IMPORTANT PERSONS, AND POLITICIANS IN THE
UNITED STATES HAVE ISSUED STATEMENTS AFFIRMING THAT THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS.
THE TESTIMONY GIVEN BY THE LADY WHO WITNESSED THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY CRIME HAS CAUSED POLITICAL UPHEAVAL THAT IS ALSO BEING FELT
IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE U.S.  CONGRESS, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE
PENTAGON.

   EVEN ELLIOTT ABRAMS, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS, HAS STATED ON THE FACE THE NATION TELEVISION
PROGRAM ON 27 NOVEMBER, THAT THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS, A WOMAN,
AND HER DAUGHTER WAS AN ACTION BY THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND NOT
THE FMLN .  ABRAMS,
A FORMER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, STATED: BASED ON 10 YEARS
EXPERIENCE ON THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, I PRESUME THAT THE DEATH OF THE
PRIESTS WAS NOT THE WORK OF LEFTIST GUERRILLAS, BUT AN ACTION BY
FORCES OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION.  WE DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF
GUERRILLAS TAKING THIS SORT OF ACTION, SAID ELLIOT ABRAMS.  HE ADDED
THAT, IN THE PAST, MANY MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH
THE SO-CALLED DEATH SQUADS AND THE RIGHTIST SECTOR IN EL SALVADOR.
THESE WERE THE STATEMENTS BY ELLIOT ABRAMS.  VOA HAS REPORTED THE
STATEMENTS BY THE WOMAN WHO WITNESSED THE CRIME.  AT THIS TIME IN THE
UNITED STATES, THE SALVADORAN TOP MILITARY COMMAND, COLONEL RENE
EMILIO PONCE, AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE BEING POINTED OUT AS
THE PERSONS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME.

   IN RELATION TO THIS, WE WANT TO DENOUNCE THE FOLLOWING TO THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA.  OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE CRISTIANI
ADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES
THAT IS PRESENTLY CENTERED ON THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THE
INVOLVEMENT OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS CRIME.  WE DENOUNCE
THE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO AS PART OF A SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL
PUBLIC OPINION FROM THE JESUITS' CASE.  WE ALSO DENOUNCE THE ARREST OF
JENNIFER CAZOLO AS A REPRESSIVE ACT.  ALSO, THE ARMED FORCES IS TRYING
TO LINK HUMANITARIAN AID FOR EL SALVADOR, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND U.S.-BASED
ORGANIZATIONS TO THE FMLN.  IT IS TRYING TO LINK THESE ORGANIZATIONS
AND THESE PERSONS TO THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN COMPLETELY DENIES THAT IT HAS ANY LINK WITH U.S. CITIZEN
JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE DENOUNCE THIS ACCUSATION AS A CLUMSY SET UP BY
THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND, WHICH IS TRYING -- WE REPEAT -- TRYING TO
REPRESS THESE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.  THIS IS A
SET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REPRESS FOREIGN CITIZENS AND -- WE
REPEAT -- IT IS A SMOKE SCREEN TO DIVERT U.S. ATTENTION FROM THE CASE
THAT IS PRESENTLY ON THE TABLE.  IT IS A SET UP TO NOT ATTEND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT
PRIESTS.

   IF ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN
AFFAIRS, WHO KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT EL SALVADOR, SAYS THAT IT WAS NOT THE
FMLN AND THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY MILITARY UNITS AND PERSONS
LINKED TO THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, HIS STATEMENTS WILL HAVE
STRONG REPERCUSSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND
AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO
THROW A SMOKESCREEN HERE AND THERE TO TRY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, ESPECIALLY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED
STATES.

   IN CONCLUSION, WE REAFIRM: WE DENY THE ARMED FORCES' ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE STATE THAT THE ACCUSATION IS
A CLUMSY SET UP TO HIDE AND NOT RESPOND TO THE QUESTION EVERYONE IS
ASKING -- WHERE ARE THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS?  BEHIND THE CLUMSY
SET UP WITH REGARD TO THE U.S. CITIZEN, WE ALSO SEE THAT THEY INTEND
TO CONTINUE TO REPRESS HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENT
SECTORS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY WITH EL SALVADOR.  IN SHORT,
ALL THIS SET UP ATTEMPTS TO DO IS THROW A HUGE SMOKESCREEN TO REPRESS
THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.
