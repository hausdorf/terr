 THE PRO-CASTROITE ARMY OF
NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) OF COLOMBIA DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE TECA
- VASCONIA OIL PIPELINE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY LAST NIGHT,
THE COLOMBIAN OIL ENTERPRISE (ECOPETROL) OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED TODAY.

   THE NEW TERRORIST ACTION WAS STAGED IN PUERTO BOYACA WHERE THE OIL
PIPELINE WAS DESTROYED AND MUCH ELN PROPAGANDA WAS STREWN.

   ECOPETROL STATED THAT THE ATTACK OCCURRED "DESPITE THE SUBVERSIVE
GROUP'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WILL SUSPEND THIS TYPE OF ACTION TO
FACILITATE THE PUBLIC DEBATE OF OIL POLICY."

   THIS OIL PIPELINE CONNECTS VASCONIA IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY WITH THE LINE THAT GOES TO BARRANCABERMEJA IN CENTRAL COLOMBIA
WHERE ECOPETROL HAS ITS MAIN REFINERY.

   THE ELN, A GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS BEEN WAGING AN ARMED STRUGGLE
FOR 25 YEARS AND IS LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, CLAIMS
THAT THE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE HYDROCARBONS AND MINING INDUSTRIES IS A
WAY OF PREVENTING INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES FROM SACKING THE COUNTRY'S
NATURAL RESOURCES.

   SINCE JANUARY 1988 WHEN IT BEGAN ITS ATTACKS ON OIL PIPELINES, THE
ELN HAS CARRIED OUT MORE THAN 130 ATTACKS AGAINST THE TECA - VASCONIA
PIPELINE, THE PACIFIC PIPELINE, AND THE COUNTRY'S MAIN OIL ARTERY, THE
CANO LIMON - COVENAS PIPELINE.
