     WE WANT TO THANK REPORTERS LIKE YOU

EIGHT YEARS TO INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT ROLDOS' ACCIDENT, AND IT WAS
NOT UNTIL TODAY THAT WE WERE SUMMONED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE MULTIPARTY

SELFLESSLY AND WHO HAVE NOT TRIED TO WITHHOLD THE INFORMATION.  I

HOMICIDE.  WE WILL TELL THE COUNTRY WHO THE MAIN POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR
WAS AGAINST PRESIDENT ROLDOS.  WE WILL PROVE THIS WITH DOCUMENTS
BECAUSE WE WILL NOT BE TALKING ABOUT .  WE WILL
REVEAL WHAT THIS POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR SAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S
DEATH AND AFTER HIS ASSASSINATION.
