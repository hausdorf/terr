 THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MASS
MEDIA HAS REGARDED THE INTENTION OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT  WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING
CONSTITUTION AS A DEVIATION FROM RECENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE REBELS.

   THE INTENTION IS OUTLINED IN A STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRESIDENT IN
REPSONSE TO THE REBEL PROPOSAL TO GIVE UP THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND JOIN
THE POLITICAL LIFE IF THE ARMY CLEANS UP ITS RANKS, IF REPRESSIONS ARE
STOPPED, ELECTIONS TO MUNICIPAL AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES ARE HELD
EARLIER THAN 1991 AND IF THE ELECTION SYSTEM IS REFORMED.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA, THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS
WILL BE DOMINATE THE FMLN TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN
COSTA RICA IN OCTOBER.

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE SALVADORAN POLICE HAVE STAGED ANOTHER ACT OF
VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR.  SPECIAL POLICE UNITS DISPERSED A
DEMONSTRATION ORGANISED BY THE FEDERATION OF SALVADORAN TRADE UNIONS
IN PROTEST AGAINST THE ARREST OF 12 ACTIVISTS OF WORKERS' AND PEASANT
ORGANISATIONS.  ABOUT 100 DEMONSTRATORS SHELTERED IN A CATHEDRAL.
BUT, THE POLICE SMASHED THE CATHEDRAL'S WINDOWS AND SHOT TEAR GAS INTO
THE BUILDING.  POLICEMEN ALSO OPENED FIRE AND ARMY HELICOPTERS CIRCLED
OVER THE CATHEDRAL.

   DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE INSIDE WERE WOUNDED, THE POLICE
DID NOT ALLOW RED CROSS REPRESENTATIVES TO APPROACH THE CATHEDRAL, AS
DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDED.

   ABOUT 60 DEMONSTRATORS WERE FIRST BRUTALLY BEATEN AND THEN
ARRESTED, THE SAN SALVADORAN MASS MEDIA SAID.
