 A MILITARY SPOKESMAN
HAS REPORTED THAT ONE CIVILIAN WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHER PEOPLE,
INCLUDING A POLICEMAN, WERE INJURED TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION
OF A GRENADE THROWN AT A POLICE PATROL CAR BY ALLEGED URBAN GUERRILLA
COMMANDOS.

   THE CIVILIAN WHO WAS KILLED HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS JOSE OVIDIO
GOMEZ, A TAXI DRIVER, AND THE INJURED POLICEMAN IS RICARDO ANTONIO
MARTINEZ.  MARTINEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE INJURED, SOME
SERIOUSLY, WERE TAKEN TO A SAN SALVADOR MEDICAL CENTER.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, THE GRENADE WAS THROWN AT 0630 (1230 GMT)
TODAY.  THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CENTRAL MARKETPLACE, SAN
SALVADOR'S MOST IMPORTANT SUPPLY CENTER, WHICH IS VERY CROWDED AT THAT
TIME OF DAY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS, BUT
THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR IT.

   THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL SINCE THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT BEGAN LAST WEDNESDAY IN
VENEZUELA.

   THE TALKS ARE IN THEIR SIXTH DAY TODAY AND THERE IS AN ATMOSPHERE
OF OPTIMISM.  ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE DIALOGUE, IMPORTANT
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO SECURE THE PACIFICATION OF EL SALVADOR,
WHICH FOR A DECADE HAS BEEN ENDURING A CIVIL WAR IN WHICH MORE THAN
70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED.
