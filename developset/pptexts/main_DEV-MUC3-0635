 THE GUERRILLAS'
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT THEY DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CAUSED GREAT SURPRISE AMONG VARIOUS CIRCLES
IN THE COUNTRY THAT VOWED TO MAKE NEW EFFORTS TO REESTABLISH THEM.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SUSPENDED ITS
DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO PROTEST
A DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE HEADQUARTERS OF A LABOR UNION ON 31 OCTOBER
THAT LEFT 10 DEAD AND 30 INJURED.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN WORKERS
NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION (FENASTRAS).

   THE FMLN, IN A COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ITS TOP FIVE LEADERS, STATED
THAT "WE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIALOGUE TO BE USED TO
COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT MASSACRE."

   IT ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE OAS, UNITED NATIONS, AND THE CHURCH OFFER
GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR'S OPPOSITION GROUPS.

   REVEREND EDGAR PALACIOS, COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR
THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE (CPDN), WHICH IS MADE UP OF OVER 60 SOCIAL
ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE REGRET THIS KIND OF DECISION
VERY MUCH, BUT WE WILL IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE GUERRILLAS TO TRY TO
RESUME THE DIALOGUE."

   PALACIOS ADDED THAT "IF THE DOOR OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION IS
CLOSED, THE DOOR OF WAR WILL OPEN."

   EDUARDO COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE
MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY, SAID THAT THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE GUERRILLAS "MUST CONTINUE."

   "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
(ARENA) MUST INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME
COMMITTED AGAINST FENASTRAS; HOWEVER, THE DIALOGUE MUST NOT BE
SUSPENDED," COLINDRES ADDED.

   JUAN JOSE MARTEL, LEADER OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT
(MPSC), WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE,
EXPRESSED SURPRISE OVER THE GUERRILLAS' DECISION.

   MARTEL SAID THAT RIGHT-WING SALVADORAN GROUPS ARE TRYING TO
ELIMINATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, WHICH SEEKS TO END THE WAR THROUGH
NEGOTIATED POLITICAL MEANS.

   SO FAR, NO GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS REACTED TO THE FMLN'S DECISION
TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MID-SEPTEMBER AND WOULD HAVE
CONTINUED ON 20 AND 21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

   PALACIOS, ALONG WITH OTHER RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND LABOR LEADERS,
HEADED A MARCH TO ACCOMPANY THE BODIES OF 10 WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED
DURING THE DYNAMITE ATTACK ON THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN
SAN SALVADOR, ONLY 200 METERS FROM A NATIONAL POLICE GARRISON.

   THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES, INCLUDING THAT OF FENASTRAS LEADER FEBE
ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND WORKERS WHO
SHOUTED ANTIGOVERNMENT SLOGANS AND CARRIED RED FLOWERS.

   TENSION WAS HIGH DURING THE MARCH, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY
MILITARY PRESENCE IN SAN SALVADOR'S MAIN STREETS AND BECAUSE THE
UNION MEMBERS DETAINED AT LEAST 30 PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN WHO,
ACCORDING TO THE UNIONISTS, INFILTRATED THE DEMONSTRATION.

   THE MARCH ENDED AT THE GENERAL CEMETERY WHERE THE BODIES OF THE
UNION MEMBERS WERE BURIED.
