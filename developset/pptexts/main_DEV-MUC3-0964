 MILITARY AUTHORITIES HAVE
REPORTED THAT, FOR THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW, STRONG BATTLES ARE BEING
WAGED IN TONACATEPEQUE, APPROXIMATELY 14 KM NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE REBELS, THROUGH THEIR CLANDESTINE RADIO STATIONS, HAVE
CONFIRMED THESE REPORTS ADDING THAT THE BATTLES ARE BEING WAGED
AGAINST SALVADORAN AIR FORCE TROOPS BECAUSE THIS AREA IS CONSIDERED AN
AIR FORCE "SECURITY ZONE."

   CLASHES WERE ALSO REPORTED IN SANTIAGO AND SAN JUAN NONUALCO, LA
PAZ DEPARTMENT, 28 OR 30 KM SOUTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR.

   MEANWHILE, IN SAN SALVADOR, LARGE AREAS OF THE CITY WERE WITHOUT
ELECTRICITY THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF THE RATIONING IMPOSED TO REPAIR
THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS WEEKEND'S SABOTAGE ACTIONS.  YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON THE RESIDENTS OF SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE WESTERN
SECTOR OF THE CITY, WERE ALARMED WHEN THEY HEARD APPROXIMATELY 50
EXPLOSIONS.  MILITARY SOURCES LATER EXPLAINED THAT SOLDIERS WERE
SHELLING REBEL POSITIONS IN THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO AREA.
