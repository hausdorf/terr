 ACCORDING TO CIVILIAN
EYEWITNESSES, SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS BOMBED THE UNIVERSITY'S SCHOOL OF
MEDICINE.

   THE SAME SOURCES REPORTED THAT SOLDIERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
CAPTURED AND BLINDFOLDED 10 UNIVERSITY GUARDS YESTERDAY AND THEN TOOK THEM
OFF THE CAMPUS.

   ACCORDING TO THESE EYEWITNESSES, ARMY TROOPS ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY OF
EL SALVADOR USING AN ARMORED VEHICLE AND A 105-MM CANNON.  THEY SAID THAT
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS BOMBED LATER ON.  HOWEVER, OFFICIAL SOURCES
HAVE NEITHER CONFIRMED NOR DENIED THIS REPORT.

   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE ACCUSED THE UNIVERSITY
OF EL SALVADOR OF BEING A GUERRILLA "SANCTUARY" AND HAVE SAID THAT THE 1ST
INFANTRY BRIGADE WAS ATTACKED FROM THE CAMPUS.

   IN ADDITION, THESE EYEWITNESSES SAID THAT 10 UNIVERSITY "GUARDS" WERE
CAPTURED ON CAMPUS, WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE, ONE OF
THE GARRISONS ATTACKED BY THE GUERRILLAS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE REBEL
OFFENSIVE BEGUN ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER.

   ACCORDING TO THESE SOURCES, THE SOLDIERS SEIZED PROPAGANDA MATERIAL.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) BEGAN AN OFFENSIVE
ON 11 NOVEMBER, WHICH HAS INCLUDED AN ATTACK ON THE HOMES OF IMPORTANT
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THAT OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI.

   ON THE SAME NIGHT, THE REBELS ALSO ATTACKED THE NATIONAL POLICE
HEADQUARTERS IN ZACAMIL, ONE OF THE MOST POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS MILITARY POSITIONS IN A DOZEN
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THIS CAPITAL. THE
FIGHTING THEN SPREAD TO SANTA ANA, CABANAS, LA PAZ, SAN VICENTE, SAN
MIGUEL, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTH, CENTRAL, AND
EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

   THE REBEL OFFENSIVE HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES --
APPROXIMATELY 300 ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND 400 ACCORDING TO THE
GUERRILLAS.  THIS COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE A STATE OF SIEGE AND
A CURFEW THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
