 AS WE SAID EARLIER, THERE ARE THREE POSITIONS.  THIS
PROVES THAT THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS SURROUNDING THIS CASE.  THERE IS
WILLIAM WALKER, ACTING LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH HIS HEAD STUCK IN THE
GROUND.  AND THERE IS CRISTIANI'S POSITION -- THE DEATH SQUAD MEMBER
WHO WEARS A TIE, WHO  AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY , AND WHO SAID THAT RASH JUDGMENT SHOULD
NOT BE PASSED AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE IN A HURRY TO ACCUSE THE
GOVERNMENT OR ANYONE ELSE.  AND THERE IS ALSO THE GENERAL STAFF AND
DEFENSE MINISTRY POSITION BLAMING THE FMLN.  WHY?  IF IT IS TRUE THAT
THERE IS A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR, THEN WHY CAN THE
DEFENSE MINISTER APPEAR BEFORE THE TELEVISION CAMERAS CONTRADICTING
CRISTIANI, GOING AGAINST WHAT CRISTIANI HAD SAID?  WHO GIVES THE
ORDERS HERE, LARIOS OR CRISTIANI?  IF CRISTIANI GIVES THE ORDERS, THEN
THE DEFENSE MINISTER MUST OBEY CRISTIANI AND REFRAIN FROM MAKING
ACCUSATIONS BEFORE A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IS HELD.  HOWEVER, THIS IS
NOT THE CASE.

   THIS FURTHER PROVES WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING.  THE CIVILIAN MASK
FELL ON SATURDAY.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY HOLDS THE REAL POWER IN THE
COUNTRY.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CENSORS THE PRESS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE
THE ONES CENSORING THE TELEVISION STATIONS, AND NOT THE ARENA
 FOLLOWERS OR OTHER
CIVILIANS.  THE GENERAL STAFF, THE SOLDIERS, ARE GAGGING THE PRESS,
IMPOSING THE STATE OF SIEGE, GIVING THE FINAL ORDERS.  IT IS IMPORTANT
TO LOOK INTO THIS CLOSELY BECAUSE GEN LARIOS, IN AN EMPTY SPEECH -- WE
HEARD HIM DELIVER A RHETORICAL AND EMPTY SPEECH -- ACCUSED THE FMLN OF
KILLING THE PRIESTS AND SAID THAT THE ARMY CONTROLS THE COUNTRY.  WE
POINT OUT THESE CONTRADICTIONS .

   BY SAYING THAT THEY DID NOT DO IT, THAT THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO
IT, THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT HE DID IT, THAT HE IS ONE OF
THE KILLERS.  THAT IS WHAT GEN LARIOS IS SAYING, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID
IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENT.   NO DOUBT, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS .  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN
THE GOVERNMENT'S INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE PAST EXAMPLES OF IT.
WE HAVE MONSIGNOR ROMERO'S CASE AND WE HAVE THE CASE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, WHO, A FEW YEARS AGO, WERE
ARRESTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT DURING A POLICE OPERATION.  HOWEVER, NOT A
SINGLE SOLDIER HAS BEEN PUNISHED.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN CRISTIANI'S
JUSTICE.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS PUTTING ON THE PRESSURE AND
CRISTIANI WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  HE WILL PROBABLY PUT UP SOME
ACT.  THE U.S.  CONGRESS ALSO HAS ITS EYES ON EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE
DEBATING THE ISSUE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THE
U.S.  CONGRESS MUST THINK ABOUT.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SAID
THAT IT IS PLEASED WITH THE WAY CRISTIANI ACTED IN THE FACE OF THE
FMLN OFFENSIVE.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS
APPROVED THE DROPPING OF WHITE PHOSPHORUS OVER ZACAMIL AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOMES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
STATE HAS APPROVED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, AND ALSO THE
MASSACRE OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN CITIZENS WHO WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR
HOMES AND KILLED ON THE SAME BLACK NIGHT WHEN THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE
KILLED.
