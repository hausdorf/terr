 ARGENTINE FOREIGN
MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND HIS PERUVIAN COUNTERPART GUILLERMO LARCO
COX SIGNED THREE INTEGRATION AGREEMENTS TODAY IN TRUJILLO, LIBERTAD
DEPARTMENT.  CAVALLO SAID THAT THE AGREEMENTS "CLEARLY SHOW THE
EFFORTS BEING MADE TOWARD COMMON GOAL" WHICH MEANS "MOVING AHEAD TO
BUILD A GREAT LATIN AMERICAN NATION."

   THE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WERE PREPARED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF
THE TWO COUNTRIES, WERE SIGNED TODAY BY THE TWO FOREIGN MINISTERS IN
THE OLD HOUSE THAT BELONGED TO SIMON BOLIVIAR DURING THE TIME HE LIVED
IN TRUJILLO.  THE CEREMONY WAS HELD UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES,
SEEKING TO PREVENT SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS.  SECURITY MEASURES WERE
REINFORCED IN THE LAST FEW HOURS FOLLOWING AN ATTACK EARLY THIS
MORNING 12 BLOCS FROM THE HOTEL WHERE THE DELEGATIONS ARE STAYING.

   THE FIRST AGREEMENT CREATES THE POLITICAL COORDINATION AND
INTEGRATION COMMITTEE.  CAVALLO SAID THAT THIS IS AIMED AT "TAKING
MORE ORDERLY STEPS IN THE EFFORTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY BECAUSE THE ARGENTINE AND PERUVIAN DESIRE FOR INTEGRATION HAS
ROOTS AS OLD AS THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE."

   THE SECOND AGREEMENT REFERS TO THE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS FOR THE
PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  CAVALLO SAID: "THIS
PROBLEM IS REACHING TERRIFYING DIMENSIONS BECAUSE ITS ECONOMIC POWER
IS MIXED WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE GROUPS.  AS SUCH IT IS BECOMING
A GROWING THREAT TO THE LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES."

   IN A BRIEF SPEECH CAVALLO ALSO REFERRED TO THE THIRD AGREEMENT TO
PREVENT DOUBLE TAXATION AMONG AIR AND MARITIME ENTERPRISES.  HE SAID:
"INTEGRATION REQUIRES GOOD TRANSPORTATION METHODS WITH WHICH TO BRING
PEOPLE CLOSER TOGETHER" THUS MAKING "PROGRESS THROUGH CONCRETE
MECHANISMS IN THE INTEGRATION PROCESS IN WHICH OUR COUNTRIES ARE
INVOLVED."

   LARCO COX SAID THAT THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS "ARGENTINE PRESIDENT
CARLOS MENEM HAS CONFIRMED, THROUGH HIS REPRESENTATIVE, HIS POLITICAL
WILL TO AGREE" TO FIND SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE REGION
BY SEEKING "NEW ROADS FOR UNDERSTANDING AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR ALREADY
RICH BILATERAL RELATIONS."

   A FEW HOURS BEFORE THIS CEREMONY, WHICH WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY UNDER
SECRETARY JOSE LUIS FERNANDEZ VALONI AND AMBASSADOR JULIAN LICASTRO,
TRUJILLO WAS SHAKEN AT 0400 BY FOUR POWERFUL DYNAMITE EXPLOTIONS (A
FIFTH BOMB DID NOT EXPLODE) WHICH DESTROYED ABOUT HALF DOZEN OFFICES
OF THE NATIONAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE.

   THIS ENTERPRISE, WHICH OPERATES WITH STATE AND PRIVATE CAPITAL, IS
LOCATED IN THE MONSERRATE DISTRICT WHERE THERE IS A HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT FOR POOR PEOPLE.  IT IS LOCATED 1 KM FROM THE PARADE
GROUND, DOWNTOWN TRUJILLO, ACROSS FROM WHICH IS LOCATED THE TURISTA
HOTEL.  THIS IS THE HOTEL WHERE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA,
PERU, COLOMBIA, URUGUAY, BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA ARE STAYING.

   THE EXPLOSIONS DID NOT CAUSE ANY CASUALTIES AND THE POLICE HOLD THE
TUPAC AMARY REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.
