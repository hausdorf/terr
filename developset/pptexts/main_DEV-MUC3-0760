 SALVADORAN
FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE MANUEL PACAS CASTRO TODAY CONDEMNED THE
ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN IN HIS COUNTRY, AND HE
BLAMED THE ULTRALEFTIST GROUPS FOR IT, ALTHOUGH HE SAID HE HAD NO
PROOF.

   "IT IS A REPUGNANT CRIME," SAID THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO WAS
ATTENDING THE 19TH OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND HE DESCRIBED THE
ASSASSINATIONS AS A "DESPERATE ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEFT."

   JOAO BAENA SOARES, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE OAS, WAS ASKED TODAY TO
REPORT TO THE ASSEMBLY ON THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IN COMPLIANCE
WITH THE RESOLUTION ON THAT COUNTRY THAT WAS APPROVED ON TUESDAY.

   A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY BY A FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT  SPOKESMAN IN WASHINGTON BLAMED THE SALVADORAN
ARMY FOR THE CRIME, AND ADDED THAT "ALL OF THE BODIES HAD BULLET
WOUNDS IN THE HEAD, INDICATING THAT THEY WERE EXECUTED."

   PACAS CASTRO SAID TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, HEADED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WILL MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT TO A DIALOGUE TO
DISCUSS THE SUSPENSION OF THE HOSTILITIES AND TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNAL
PEACE PROCESS.

   MOREOVER, HE ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL MISSION, CAPABLE OF MAKING
DECISIONS AND COMMITMENTS, WILL TRAVEL TO CARACAS IN THE HOPE OF
MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FMLN GUERRILLAS.

   THE SALVADORAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE SITUATION IN HIS COUNTRY
IS UNDER CONTROL AND THAT ARMY TROOPS ARE SLOWLY MOVING INTO THE
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS TO AVOID BLOODSHED AMONG THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.

   AS FOR A REQUEST BY THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO CALL FOR A
CEASE-FIRE FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS TO TREAT THE WOUNDED AND CIVILIAN
VICTIMS, PACAS CASTRO SAID THAT THE FIRST-AID BRIGADES CONTINUE TO DO
THEIR WORK IN EL SALVADOR.

   AS FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, HE
SAID "HE CONDEMNED THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE" BECAUSE IGNACIO ELLACURIA,
ONE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WAS KILLED, "WAS MY TEACHER," AND HE
DESCRIBED THE PRIEST AS A VERY VALUABLE MAN WHO WORKED FOR PEACE AND
FOR THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE POPULATION.

   COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO MADRIGAL NIETO, IN STATEMENTS
TO THE PRESS, REGRETTED THE DEATH OF THE CLERGYMEN.  "WORKING FOR
PEACE IS VERY DIFFICULT," HE SAID.

   MADRIGAL NIETO SAID TODAY HE HOPED THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS WOULD CONTINUE DESPITE THE WAR.

STATEMENTS OF HIS COSTA RICAN COLLEAGUE, AND HE CONDEMNED THE USE OF
VIOLENCE AS A POLITICAL TOOL.
