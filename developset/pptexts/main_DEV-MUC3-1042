 SOME 150
PEOPLE THREW STONES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY TODAY TO
PROTEST THE PRESENCE AT THE EMBASSY OF 12 REFUGEES CLOSELY LINKED TO
FORMER GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA.

   RESIDENTS OF A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY
SHOUTING SLOGANS AGAINST THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN REFUGEES, WHOM THEY
SHOUTED SHOULD BE "SHOT," AND AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT FOR
GRANTING THEM ASYLUM.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS, WHO BROKE THE WINDSHIELDS OF SOME VEHICLES
PASSING IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY, WERE FORCED AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF
THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE AND U.S.
SOLDIERS.

   THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY ARE
MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, SPOKESMEN OF THE FORMER DEFENSE FORCES;
MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, CHIEF OF THE ELITE "MACHO DE MONTE" COMPANY;
NORIEGA'S FORMER SECRETARY, MARCELA TASON; CAPTAIN NARCISA CASTILLERO;
MAJOR HERACLIDES SUCRE; AND SEVEN RELATIVES OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED
PEOPLE.

      SUCRE WAS CHARGED TODAY BY PANAMANIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROGELIO
CRUZ WITH BEING INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI,
WHO PROMOTED A FOILED COUP AGAINST NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989.

   PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO
PROTECT "AS LONG AS NECESSARY" THE FORMER NORIEGA AIDES WHO SOUGHT
SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA.

   PERU ANNOUNCED ON 9 JANUARY THAT IT HAS GRANTED ASYLUM TO FIVE
PANAMANIAN MILITARY AND SEVEN OF THEIR RELATIVES.  THE PANAMANIAN
GOVERNMENT SAID ON 12 JANUARY THAT IT WILL NOT GRANT SAFE-CONDUCT FOR
THESE PEOPLE, WHOM IT CONSIDERS "COMMON CRIMINALS," TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.

   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ON 11 JANUARY SAID THE PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE
IS IN CHARGE OF GUARDING THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND POINTED OUT THAT THE
SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS POSED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE REFUGEES SHOULD BE
HANDLED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF PANAMA AND PERU.

   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PANAMANIAN
PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA IS "UNLAWFUL."  HE ADDED THAT PANAMA IS
BEING RULED BY "THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE PENTAGON, THE SOUTHERN
COMMAND, AND THE U.S.  TROOPS."
