 FROM THE
SOVIET POINT OF VIEW, THE QUESTION OF DELIVERIES OF WEAPONS TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR TAKES ON, IN PRESENT CONDITIONS, A PARTICULAR
SIGNIFICANCE.  THIS WAS ANNOUNCED TODAY AT A BRIEFING BY GENNADIY GERASIMOV,
HEAD OF THE USSR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS INFORMATION DIRECTORATE, WHO
REPORTED THE DEBATES OPENING IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON GIVING U.S.  MILITARY
AID TO THAT COUNTRY.

   IN RECENT TIMES, THE USSR FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN NOTED, CERTAIN
ADVANCES HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE MATTER OF RENEWING DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE OPPOSING SIDES IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE OPPONENTS OF NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION IN THAT COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT A CONSTRUCTIVE
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS AND ARE COUNTING ON THE
CONTINUATION OF BLOODSHED.  THE EL SALVADOR PRESIDENT ALFONSO CRISTIAN
CONFIRMED THE INVOLVEMENT OF TROOPS IN THE MURDER OF PRIESTS.  A NEW
VICTIM OF THE TERROR IS HECTOR OQUELI, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON THE PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRIES OF
LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN BASIN AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT PARTY, SAID GENNADIY GERASIMOV.

   THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT,
THE SOVIET DIPLOMAT NOTED, HAS STATED ITS DECISION TO STOP CONDUCTING
FURTHER COMBAT OPERATIONS IF THE UNITED STATES HALTS ITS MILITARY AID
TO THE RULING REGIME.

   IN THESE CONDITIONS, GERASIMOV STRESSED, THE CONTINUATION OF ARMS
SUPPLIES TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN FACT PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE
WHO BLATANTLY VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS AND DOES NOT PROMOTE THE
STRENGTHENING OF THE POSITIONS OF THOSE WHO CHAMPION DIALOGUE AND
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN EL SALVADOR.  "ALL OF THAT MAY BECOME A
SERIOUS OBSTACLE IN THE WAY TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN THAT
COUNTRY AND CENTRAL AMERICA IN GENERAL", HE SAID.
