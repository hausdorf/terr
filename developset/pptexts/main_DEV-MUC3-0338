 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTY MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON
SAID TODAY THAT THE POSITION ADOPTED BY EL SALVADOR THROUGH PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AT THE SUMMIT IN TELA, HONDURAS, IS POSITIVE BECAUSE
EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  HOWEVER,
HE SAID THAT THE POSITION OF THE FMLN  WILL ACTUALLY BE VERY CRITICAL NOW.  THE FMLN WILL
NOT LOOK GOOD INTERNATIONALLY IF IT REJECTS THE DIALOGUE.

   HERE IS AN EXCERPT OF D'AUBUISSON'S STATEMENTS, IN WHICH HE ALSO REVEALED
THAT COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS HAS OFFERED TO MEDIATE THE DIALOGUE.

     ... FALLACIES. THIS IS
NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE CLAIMED TO WANT SOMETHING AND ENDED UP
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR
INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AND DO NOT WANT TO LOOK LIKE 
BEFORE THE LITTLE MANGY-DOGS WHO GO ABOUT PLANTING BOMBS HERE.  THEY
WANT TO DEMONSTRATE PERHAPS THAT THEY ALWAYS HOLD A HEGEMONIC POSITION
HERE AND WILL TRY TO OBTAIN A BETTER NEGOTIATING POSITION FOR THEIR
ILLEGAL FORCES, WHICH ARE STILL GOING AROUND  AND
KILLING PEOPLE .

    NEVERTHELESS, MAJOR, DO YOU VIEW THIS MEETING AS POSITIVE
 WITH THE FMLN -- THAT IS, THE DIALOGUE -- NOW THAT
SOMETHING TANGIBLE HAS COME OUT OF THE SUMMIT?  DO YOU THINK PEACE CAN BE
ACHIEVED?

    THE OBJECTIVE OF ALL SALVADORANS -- AND IN THIS REGARD WE
SPEAK FROM THE HEART -- IS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  IF THE FMLN COOPERATES, WE
WELCOME ITS COOPERATION.  HOWEVER, IF IT DOES NOT COOPERATE, THERE WILL BE
FMLN MEMBERS WHO WILL DEMOBILIZE, THE SAME WAY SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE  ARE DESERTING.  THESE PEOPLE HAD TO BE GIVEN GUARANTEES.  WE
WILL SEE LATER IF, AS THEY SAY, THEY ARE TRULY WORKING, OR STRUGGLING, FOR
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE  MORE POSITIVE ACTIONS.

   HOWEVER, WE SEE EVERYTHING AS BEING WELL ON THE WAY TO ACHIEVING PEACE IN
A SHORT TIME.  

   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT IF THE FMLN DOES NOT AGREE TO THE DEMOBILIZATION,
THE FMLN MEMBERS WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE IF PEACE IS NOT ACHIEVED.
REGARDING THE COMMISSION, HE SAID IT IS ALREADY BEING ORGANIZED AND WILL
BEGIN A DIALOGUE SOON.

     ...A CONTINUOUS
DIALOGUE TO FIND SOLUTIONS.  THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS
INSTRUCTED THAT IT HAVE NO PRIOR AGENDA BUT THAT IT JUST BEGIN.  THEIR
FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE TO TALK, TO NEGOTIATE, TO
ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE.  AND THIS IS TO GO ON CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL SOLUTIONS
ARE FOUND AND THEY ACHIEVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE, WHICH IS THE FINAL
SOLUTION.

     

    WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT ARIAS HAS
OFFERED TO ACT AS MEDIATOR OR INTERMEDIARY.  HE SAID THAT IF THE
COMMISSION GOES TO SAN JOSE, HE WILL TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO INVITE
THESE GENTLEMEN TOO AND TO GIVE THEM WHATEVER THEY NEED FOR THIS
MEETING TO BEGIN.  AFTER THAT, THEY THEMSELVES WILL DEVELOP THE
MECHANISMS.  

   MAJ D'AUBUISSON SAID THE COMMISSION WILL BE SWORN IN AND WILL MAINTAIN AN
ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN REPRESENTATIVES.

   COMMENTING ON LEGISLATIVE WORK, HE SAID THAT TODAY THE POLITICAL
COMMITTEE WILL MEET TO ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION,
WHICH HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY NEGLECTED BY DR JAIME VENTURA.  THE ONLY
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRUPTION IS DEPUTY
ROBERTO ANGULO, VICE PRESIDENT AND ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY.
