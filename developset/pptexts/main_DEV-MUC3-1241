 GOOD EVENING.  WE
COLOMBIANS HAD NOT GOTTEN OVER YESTERDAY'S CRUEL ATTACK IN MEDELLIN
WHEN WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH ANOTHER DISGRACE THAT TOOK THE LIFE OF
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO.  IN A MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT VOICED ITS DEEP ANGER AND
SADNESS OVER THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK AND IT RATIFIED ITS DETERMINATION TO
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITHOUT DISMAY AGAINST ALL FORMS OF CRIMES AND
THE CRIMINALS WHO ARE SO INFAMOUSLY ATTACKING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.

   THIS IS NO TIME TO ABANDON ANY ATTITUDE THAT IS DEEMED ADVISABLE
FOR THE NATION.  IN THE FACE OF THE FRATRICIDAL AND ANTI-PATRIOTIC
VIOLENCE, WE MUST ANSWER WITH ACTIONS OF UNDERSTANDING AND
CONCILIATION, WITH DECISIONS THAT WILL DISMANTLE THE BANDS OF
CRIMINALS WHO ARE DOING SUCH SERIOUS HARM TO THE PEOPLE AND WITH THE
DETERMINATION THAT WILL RENEW FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND IN
THE PURPOSE TO ACHIEVE THE BEST LEVELS OF COEXISTENCE.  THE GOVERNMENT
IS DETERMINED TO DO THAT.

   HOWEVER, THIS RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH ALL COLOMBIANS OF GOODWILL.
FROM EACH OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN, WE DEMAND POSITIVE ACTIONS AND A
GREAT SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
SAFEGUARDING THE CITIZENS' SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE NATION.  THE PEACE,
UNDERSTANDING, AND CONCILIATION TO WHICH CARLOS PIZARRO WAS COMMITTED
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE BASIC GOALS OF THE COUNTRY AND OF ITS
CITIZENS.

   ALL THE NECESSARY MEASURES THAT WILL LEAD TO CLARIFYING THAT
TREACHEROUS CRIME ARE BEING TAKEN TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND
THEN PUNISH THEM.  TO THIS EFFECT, THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION WILL BE
VERY SEVERE, AND THE INVESTIGATING AUTHORITIES ARE ALREADY BEING
PROVIDED VERY AMPLE COOPERATION.

   THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT  LEADERS, AND IT HAS BEEN ATTENTIVE TO ITS DEMANDS,
CHARGES, AND CONCERNS.  THERE IS A MARKED INTEREST BECAUSE THERE
CONTINUES TO BE DIRECT RELATIONS WITH ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, THE
VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SECURITY
AND INDISPENSABLE GUARANTEES SO THAT WE WILL HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON 27
MAY, AS THE PEOPLE WANT.

   NATIONAL COEXISTENCE, TOGETHER WITH THE CITIZENS' DEMANDS FOR
REFORMS, WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BASIC GOAL OF THE GOVERNMENT OF DR.
VIRGILIO BARCO, WHO WILL TOMORROW ADDRESS THE COLOMBIANS.  M-19 HAS
ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW IT TO MAKE PUBLIC ITS FEELINGS AND
OPINIONS IN THE FACE OF THIS GREAT TRAGEDY.

   THROUGH ME, AND ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF LAW 42 OF 1985, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS REQUESTED THIS AIR TIME SO THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF,
SPOKESMAN OF THE POLITICAL PARTY WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS
BRUTALLY MURDERED TODAY, WILL BE ABLE TO FREELY EXPRESS HIS IDEAS.

   THOSE WHO SEEK TO EXCLUDE FROM THE ELECTORAL PROCESS A POLITICAL
PARTY -- REGARDLESS OF WHICH ONE IT MAY BE -- WILL NOT ACHIEVE IT,
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT ITS VOICE WILL CONTINUE TO
BE HEARD.  DESPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES, COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL WIN.
