 TODAY
RESCUE TEAMS, ARMY TROOPS, AND POLICE HAD THE SORRY TASK OF RECOVERING
107 DISFIGURED BODIES OF THE VICTIMS OF AVIANCA'S BOEING 727 THAT
EXPLODED IN MIDAIR IN A SPARSELY POPULATED REGION NEAR BOGOTA.
ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN, THE TASK IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE
THE BODIES WERE SCATTERED OVER A RADIUS OF 8 KM.  THE PLANE DEPARTED
BOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT
DOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR.  BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN
COORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO
EXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE
TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST
ACTION.  THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM
THE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S.
FEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION.
ANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK
NEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION
WAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE.  THE
POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT
CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO
AIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.
