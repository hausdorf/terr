  
THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT IN HISTORY.  THEY HAD CLEARLY
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT USE CAR BOMBS FROM NOW ON, BUT THEY USED
ONE YESTERDAY NEVERTHELESS.  THIS ACTION IS CONDEMNABLE FROM EVERY
VIEWPOINT BECAUSE THE MEMBERS, RATHER THE ALUMNI, OF CETIPOL  WHO WERE VICTIMS OF THIS ATTACK WERE UNARMED.
THEY WERE SIMPLY DOING SOME PHYSICAL EXERCISES.  IT IS ALSO DEPLORABLE
THAT A BAKER WAS KILLED AND THAT A 12-YEAR-OLD YOUTH GOING TO SCHOOL
WAS INJURED.

   WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EVENTS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE AT ALL TO THE
CREATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR SEEKING PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY.  THIS AND MANY OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH HAVE RECENTLY
OCCURRED CONTRADICT THE IMAGE THAT THE FMLN HAD PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO
CREATE WITH ITS DECISION NOT TO CONTINUE SABOTAGING THE PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS, AS WELL AS BUSINESSES.  ALL
THESE ACTIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO OCCUR.  WE WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THESE
ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY TERRORISTS WHO ARE OUT OF THE FMLN
LEADERS' CONTROL, BECAUSE, AS I SAID, THIS DOES NOT HELP AT ALL TO
CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY.

    COLONEL, REFERRING TO THE STATE OF SIEGE, WILL THE ARMED
FORCES INSIST ON KEEPING IT OR NOT?  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON THIS YESTERDAY.

    THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION ANYWAY, AND IT IS ADOPTED BY
THE ASSEMBLY -- SOMETIMES UPON REQUEST FROM...

    THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, YOU SAID.

    WE, AS AN ARMED CORPS AND WITH THE INTENTION OF HELPING
CREATE THE APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE FOR PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY, WILL MAKE
NO REQUEST TO EXTEND THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND .

    DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE ARMED FORCES DECIDED THIS
BECAUSE THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS DISAPPEARED?

    TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT CURRENT VIOLENT ACTIONS
MIGHT COME FROM GROUPS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF FMLN LEADERS, WE BELIEVE
THAT THE COUNTRY'S SITUATION IS NOT NORMAL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THERE IS
NO VIOLENCE.  HOWEVER, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THAT PROPITIOUS ATMOSPHERE
FOR THE DIALOGUE, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ADVISABLE TO LIFT IT.

    I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS: WHAT IS THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION
REGARDING ?

    AS FOR THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU ARE REFERRING TO STATEMENTS
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.  I BELIEVE THAT IN DUE TIME HE WILL
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THOSE STATEMENTS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT
THE NEWSMAN DISTORTED HIS WORDS, BUT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WILL HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE RESPECTIVE CLARIFICATION.

   I WILL, HOWEVER, STATE THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN
ISSUED BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AS TO WHETHER AT
ANY TIME COLONEL BENAVIDES HAS LEFT THE HANDS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE,
HE CLEARLY SAID THAT AT NO TIME HAS BENAVIDES DONE THIS.  HE IS UNDER
THE ORDERS OF THE 4TH PENAL JUDGE, AND AT NO TIME HAS THE 4TH PENAL
JUDGE AUTHORIZED COL. BENAVIDES TO LEAVE THE CONFINES OF THE JAIL.

   THE PERSON WHO MADE THE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE, A
PHOTOGRAPH FOR EXAMPLE.  OTHERWISE, THIS IS ALL MERE SPECULATION.
THAT IS A VERY DELICATE CASE, AND SPECULATIONS CAST A NEGATIVE IMAGE
ON THE ARMED FORCES AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF, AND EVEN ON THE
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY.

   CONCERNING WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE TRIAL OF THE MURDER OF THE
JESUITS, THE JUSTICE AUTHORITIES WILL DETERMINE WHAT WILL BE DONE.  WE
WILL RESPECT THAT DECISION.
