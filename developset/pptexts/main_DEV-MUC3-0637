 SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL ATTEND THE
MEETING WITH THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS SCHEDULED FOR 20 NOVEMBER IN
CARACAS, VENEZUELA, DESPITE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT'S (FMLN) DECISION TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE.

   CRISTIANI DISCLOSED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INVESTIGATE THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ATTACK THAT KILLED 10 TRADE UNION MEMBERS ON 31
OCTOBER, WHICH THE FMLN HAS BLAMED ON ARMY AND GOVERNMENT SECTORS.  ON
THAT DATE, THE FMLN DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE THAT HAD BEGAN ON
17 OCTOBER IN COSTA RICA.

   HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT REJECTED "THE IRRESPONSIBLE AND
MALICIOUS ACCUSATIONS MADE BY THE FMLN THAT THE ATTACK HAD BEEN
CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMED FORCES WITH THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC."

   AFTER SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ASKED THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE SALVADORAN CATHOLIC CHURCH "FOR
GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS."

   THE PRESIDENTS OF COSTA RICA AND VENEZUELA, OSCAR ARIAS AND CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ, RESPECTIVELY, TODAY OFFERED THEIR MEDIATION TO GET THE
DIALOGUE UNDER WAY.
