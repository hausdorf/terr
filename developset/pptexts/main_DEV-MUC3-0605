 THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED
THAT A CARBOMB EXPLODED TONIGHT IN A RESIDENTIAL SECTOR IN THIS
COLOMBIAN PORT OF CARTAGENA, SLIGHTLY INJURING ONLY TWO PEOPLE, BUT
CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE.  THE BOMB SERIOUSLY DAMAGED THE TELEPHONE
EXCHANGE OF THE BOCAGRANDE TOURIST AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, A HOTEL,
A RESTAURANT, TWO MEDICAL CLINICS, AND A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

   ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE TWO WOMEN WHO WERE SLIGHTLY INJURED, THE
BOMB WAS PLACED BY TWO MEN IN A CAR, WHICH THEY HURRIEDLY ABANDONED 40
METERS FROM THE TELEPHONE OFFICE.

   THE AREA, WHICH WAS BLACKED OUT WHEN THE ELECTRIC LINES WERE
DESTROYED AND WAS LITTERED WITH GLASS, WAS CORDONED OFF BY POLICE, WHO
LAUNCHED A SEARCH THROUGHOUT THE CITY FOR THE TERRORISTS.

   SERGEANT MARTINEZ OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT THE BOMB HAD
CAUSED MUCH DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH HE ABSTAINED FROM GIVING AN ESTIMATE
UNTIL THE BUILDINGS ARE EXAMINED.

   ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE BOMBING, PRESS SECTORS
BLAMED IT ON THE DRUG MAFIA AGAINST WHOM THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED
WAR.
