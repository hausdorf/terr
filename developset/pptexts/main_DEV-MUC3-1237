 GOVERNMENT MINISTER
HORACIO SERPA URIBE, WHO HAS JUST LEFT THE NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE
INSTITUTE, HAS DENOUNCED CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ' ASSASSINATION.  HE ADDED
THAT NO THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS IN THE WAKE OF
THIS DEVELOPMENT, AND ADDED THAT THE COUNTRY MUST NOT BE LEFT IN VIOLENT
HANDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER COMMENTED FURTHER ON THE TOP M-19  LEADER'S ASSASSINATION:

     THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH SAD AND CRIMINAL
DEVELOPMENTS IS TRULY A DISGRACE.  IT HAS SADDENED EVERYBODY VERY
MUCH.  I FEEL THAT THIS WAS NOT ONLY AN ATTACK AGAINST FORMER
CANDIDATE PIZARRO BUT AN ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY, DEMOCRACY, AND
THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  I FEEL THAT WE MUST RESPOND TO AGGRESSIVENESS
AND CRIME WITH FEELINGS OF CONCILIATION AND PEACE.

    HAS ANY THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN TO SUSPENDING THE ELECTIONS
AFTER THIS ASSASSINATION, BEARING IN MIND THAT PIZARRO WAS ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES?

    HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CANDIDATES.
THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY
REGARDS THE PEACEMKING PROCESS IT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT WITH THE M-19,
IN WHICH PIZARRO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A KEY PLAYER.  WE HAVE ADOPTED SOME
DECISIONS IN THIS REGARD.  I AM GOING TO MEET WITH THE HEAD OF STATE
AND ALL OF US WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHING THE SAD DEVELOPMENTS WHICH
COLOMBIA IS EXPERIENCING WITH A DESIRE TO MEET THE NEED FOR
TRANQUILLITY AND COEXISTENCE WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NOT HAD
THUS FAR.

    MR. MINISTER, WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT TWO PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN LESS THAN 40 DAYS REPRESENT TO
THE GOVERNMENT?  HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT LOOK BEFORE THE NATION AND
THE WORLD?

    WELL, I REPEAT, THIS IS A VERY SAD CIRCUMSTANCE.  THIS IS
EXTREMELY WORRISOME, OF COURSE.  LIKE ALL COLOMBIANS, WE ARE TROUBLED
OVER THE FACT THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FLOODED WITH CRIME AND
BLOODSHED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROTECT ALL
CITIZENS AND TO GUARANTEE THE ELECTIONS AND THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF
COLOMBIANS' LIVES.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE DELUDED MINDS AND THERE ARE
CRIMINALS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DAMAGING THE COUNTRY.  THIS IS AN
ATTACK AGAINST COLOMBIA, AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.

    MR. MINISTER, HAVE YOU AT ANY TIME THOUGHT OF ADOPTING
SPECIAL MEASURES?  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION IN
COLOMBIA AT THIS TIME?  WHAT REPORTS DO YOU HAVE?

    NO, THERE IS CALM IN GENERAL. THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY
WORRIED, OF COURSE.  WE ARE GOING TO MEET NOW TO DISCUSS THIS TERRIBLE
CASE.

    HOWEVER, DO YOU NOT THINK THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
GO ON CAMPAIGNING IN PUBLIC AT THIS MOMENT?

    I WOULD NOT DARE MAKE ANY ASSERTION IN THIS REGARD. WHAT I
FEEL IS THAT WE MUST NOT YIELD A SINGLE CENTIMETER TO THE VIOLENT
PEOPLE AND THE CRIMINALS.  

   SERPA MADE THESE STATEMENTS A FEW MINUTES AGO AS HE LEFT THE
NATIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE INSTITUTE, WHERE AN AUTOPSY IS BEING PERFORMED
AT THIS MOMENT ON PIZARRO'S BODY.
