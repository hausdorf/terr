 OFFICIAL SOURCES ANNOUNCED THAT A
U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT HERCULES C-123 CARGO PLANE WAS PARTIALLY
DESTROYED EARLY THIS MORNING WHEN AN INCENDIARY BOMB EXPLODED AT THE
MONTERIA AIRPORT.  MONTERIA IS THE CAPITAL OF CORDOBA DEPARTMENT AND
IT IS LOCATED 490 KM NORTH OF BOGOTA.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MONTERIA POLICE ADVISED AFP VIA TELEPHONE THAT
THE FRONT PART OF THE PLANE, AS WELL AS THE COCKPIT, WERE BURNED WHEN
A BOMB, PLANTED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, EXPLODED.  NO VICTIMS WERE
REPORTED.

   THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE WAS "SERIOUSLY
DAMAGED" BY THE FLAMES; HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY DID NOT SPECIFY THE
ORIGIN OF THE FIRE.  ACCORDING TO EMBASSY SPOKESMAN PETER SAMSON, THE
PLANE IS THE PROPERTY OF THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNATIONAL
NARCOTICS MATTERS (INM).

   THE PLANE, WHICH WAS RETURNING TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER
FULFILLING A MISSION IN PERU, HAD BEEN PARKED AT THE MONTERIA AIRPORT
FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS.  THE PLANE WAS FORCED TO LAND IN MONTERIA AFTER
ONE OF ITS ENGINES FAILED, THE EMBASSY SPOKESMAN ADDED.

   ACCORDING TO THE MONTERIA POLICE, THE FIRE BROKE OUT AFTER AN
EXPLOSION WAS HEARD.  THE FIREMEN INTERVENED QUICKLY TO PREVENT THE
FIRE FROM SPREADING AND COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE PLANE.

   THE FIRE BROKE OUT AT 0430 (0930 GMT), A FEW HOURS BEFORE TWO C-130 
PLANES--U.S. MILITARY CARGO PLANES--ARRIVED AT BOGOTA AIR FORCE
BASE WITH MILITARY MATERIEL SENT TO HELP FIGHT THE BATTLE AGAINST DRUG
