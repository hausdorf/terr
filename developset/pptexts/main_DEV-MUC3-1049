 THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS
OFFERED FULL GUARANTEES OF DUE PROCESS  TO DRUG
TRAFFICKERS WHO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND STOP THEIR TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES AND SMUGGLING OF DRUGS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT SAID IT WILL
NOT ENTER INTO DEALS WITH THEM THAT MAY VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION OR
THE LAWS.

   THE STATEMENT, WHICH WAS THE FIRST TO BE MADE BY AN OFFICIAL
SOURCE, WAS MADE BY GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS TO A TELEVISION
NEWSCAST.

   COMMENTING ON THE COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH THE EXTRADITABLES OFFER TO
END THEIR ILLEGAL TRADE, RELEASE THE HOSTAGES THEY ARE HOLDING, AND
STOP THEIR ATTACKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY
"RESPECT FOR OUR RIGHTS AND RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES,"
LEMOS SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION AND LAWS GUARANTEE A DUE
PROCESS AND RIGHT TO DEFENSE, BUT OF COURSE THEY ALSO DEMAND THAT
THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAWS SUBMIT TO THEM SO THAT, THROUGH THE JUDGES
AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY INTERVENTION BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE DEGREE OF
RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH ONE OF THEM AND WHETHER THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR
PUNISHMENT CAN BE DETERMINED."

   HE ADDED: "THESE PERSONS, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WILL ENJOY FULL
LEGAL GUARANTEES, BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE
COMPROMISES OF ANY KIND, BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE GOVERNMENT
CANNOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION."

   EXPLAINING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS WON THIS WAR ON THE BASIS OF
MAKING NO CONCESSIONS, LEMOS SAID: "I DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE
OUR POLICY OF NOT NEGOTIATING WHEN OUR OWN ENEMIES HAVE SAID THAT THIS
POLICY HAS TRIUMPHED."

   IN THEIR COMMUNIQUE, WHICH WAS DELIVERED THROUGH TWO WOMEN WHO WERE
KIDNAPPED AND RELEASED IN MEDELLIN, SEAT OF THE CARTEL BY THE SAME
NAME, THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS RECOGNIZED THE STATE'S VICTORY OVER THE
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION AND AT THE SAME TIME OFFERED TO ABIDE BY THE
LAWS.
