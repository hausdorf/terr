 INOCENTE ARIAS, THE
SPANISH UNDER FOREIGN SECRETARY, SAID TODAY THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI "PROMISED TO CARRY OUT A PROMPT AND SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION" AND "TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE" FOR THE MURDER OF SIX
JESUITS AND TWO WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER.

   ARIAS ADDED THAT THE MEETING HELD THIS AFTERNOON WITH PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI WAS "CORDIAL AND SINCERE."

   ARIAS, WHO ARRIVED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR ALONG WITH OTHER HIGH-RANKING
SPANISH OFFICIALS, SAID THAT "THE PRESIDENT SEEMS WILLING TO PROMOTE A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIBLE
MASSACRE."

   THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION CAME TO EL SALVADOR AFTER SIX JESUITS, FIVE
OF THEM SPANISH, WERE MURDERED BY INDIVIDUALS WEARING MILITARY
UNIFORMS.

   INOCENCIO ARIAS AFFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS "A LUCID,
INTELLIGENT, AND WELL-INTENDED PERSON," WHO IS "APPARENTLY INTERESTED
IN CLARIFYING THE FACTS."

   AFTER MEETING WITH ARIAS, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT EXPLAINED TO
ACAN-EFE THAT HE REQUESTED EXPERTS BE SENT FROM SPAIN, THE UNITED
STATES, AND GREAT BRITAIN.

   CRISTIANI JUSTIFIED THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN EXPERTS "FROM SPAIN,
BECAUSE THE JESUITS WERE SPANISH; FROM THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE THEY
REQUESTED IT; AND FROM GREAT BRITAIN, BECAUSE OF THE FAME OF SCOTLAND
YARD.

   ACCORDING TO ARIAS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI "WAS AFFECTED BY THE DEATHS
OF THE PRIESTS."

   ARIAS SAID THAT DURING HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR, HE WILL ALSO TRY
TO "WORK ON THE DEPARTURE OF THOSE SPANISH WHO ARE IN GREATER DANGER
IN THE COUNTRY."

   THE OFFICIAL DECLINED BLAMING ANY GROUP FOR THE DEATH OF THE
JESUITS AND THE TWO WOMEN, BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI
TOLD HIM THAT "THE REPONSIBLE PERSONS, WHOEVER THEY MAY BE, WILL BE
PUNISHED."

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES, AS AN INSTITUTION, ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE
CASE TO THE VERY END TO UNCOVER WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES."

   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THEY MAY BE MILITARY MEMBERS, HE
ANSWERED THAT "THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT RULED OUT THAT THEY MIGHT
HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE ARMY, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE
THIS THOROUGHLY."

   HOWEVER, CRISTIANI REJECTED THE "PREMATURE INTERPRETATIONS" THAT
CLAIM THE MILITARY CARRIED OUT THE MULTIPLE CRIME.

   THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TOLD THE SPANISH DIPLOMAT THAT THE
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR "WILL BE PEACEFUL IN A FEW DAYS," AND HE
REITERATED THAT HE "IS WILLING TO CONTINUE WITH THE DIALOGUE."

   HOWEVER, HE TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "WE ARE NOT GOING TO ATTEND A
MEETING THAT WILL NOT BE ATTENDED BY THE OTHER PARTY," REFERRING TO
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE NOT PLANNING TO ATTEND THE
MEETING SLATED TO START ON 20 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

   ACCORDING TO ARIAS, CRISTIANI INSISTS THAT THE SITUATION IS
"PRETTY MUCH CONTROLLED IN THE COUNTRY," ALTHOUGH THE SALVADORAN        
PRESIDENT WARNED THEM "THERE MIGHT BE NEW OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE."

   TODAY MARKS THE 8TH DAY OF THE BLOODY FIGHTING BETWEEN THE ARMY AND
THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.  IT HAS LEFT AT LEAST 1,000 PERSONS DEAD,
HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PERSONS
DISPLACED, WHO HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND TOWNS TO FLEE
FROM THE CROSSFIRE OF THE FIGHTERS AND THE BOMBINGS OF THE SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE.
