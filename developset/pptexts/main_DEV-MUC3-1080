 PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO
SAID TODAY THAT "THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES," THUS CONFIRMING
THE STATEMENT GIVEN YESTERDAY, 21 JANUARY, BY ENERGY AND MINES MINISTER RAUL
CASTANEDA.

   THE PRESIDENT ADDED: "WHAT HAPPENED WAS A RESULT OF SPECULATION.
THE GAS STATION OWNERS EXPECTED THE PRICES WOULD INCREASE WHEN THE
QUETZAL'S EXCHANGE RATE CHANGED, BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN."

   HE SAID THAT "THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED IN A SHORT TIME BECAUSE
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TAKEN CHARGE OF THE FOREIGN
EXCHANGE DIFFERENTIAL SO THAT IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE POPULATION."

   REFERRING TO THE WORKERS' DEMANDS FOR A SALARY INCREASE, PRESIDENT
CEREZO SAID THAT "WE ARE FACING PROBLEMS IN GRANTING THE INCREASE
BECAUSE THE 1990 BUDGET HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED."

   CEREZO ADDED: "THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY
CONTACTS WITH THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY
REQUESTING A BUDGET EXTENSION AND GETTING THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO GRANT
A SALARY INCREASE IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR."
