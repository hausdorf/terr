 COLONEL INOCENTE
MONTANO, SALVADORAN DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER, TODAY ADMITTED THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SEIZURE OF AN ARMS SHIPMENT IN HONDURAS ON 7
APRIL MAY MEAN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE PLANNING A NEW
MILITARY OFFENSIVE.

   ACCORDING TO MONTANO, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) MAY LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE BEFORE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT- ELECT
VIOLETA CHAMORRO ASSUMES OFFICE ON 25 APRIL.

   "WE MUST NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SALVADORAN
TERRORISTS MIGHT PROMOTE TERRORIST ACTIONS BEFORE THE SANDINISTS
RELINQUISH POWER IN ORDER TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF ANTAGONISM AGAINST
THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN MANAGUA AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE
STRENGTH," THE MILITARY OFFICER SAID.

   ACCORDING TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE ARMS SHIPMENT SEIZED
BY HONDURAN AUTHORITIES ON SATURDAY CONSISTS OF 24 AK-47 RIFLES, 24
HANDLES AND 76 CLIPS FOR THOSE WEAPONS, 80 ROLLS OF "SLOW FUSE"
WEIGHING OVER 2 KG EACH, AND A "LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIALS TO
MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES."

   THE MILITARY MATERIAL WAS BEING CARRIED IN A TRUCK BY SALVADORANS
VICTOR EMILIO DUBON AND FELICIANO GARCIA, WHO "WERE PART OF LOGISTICS
UNIT," OF THE FMLN, ACCORDING TO A PRESS COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE
ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) TODAY.

   COPREFA ADDED THAT THIS FMLN "LOGISTICS UNIT" WAS IN CHARGE OF "THE
ARMS SMUGGLING TO EL SALVADOR."

   ON 8 APRIL, ANOTHER "LARGE QUANTIITY OF MEDICINE AND SURGICAL
SUPPLIES" WAS SEIZED IN THE HONDURAN DEPARTMENT OF COPAN, WHERE THE
ARMS CARGO HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THE DAY BEFORE, COPREFA REPORTED.

   "THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AGAIN CALL ON CITIZENS TO REPORT ALL
SORTS OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE CARRIED OUT IN THEIR
COMMUNITIES AND THUS AVERT POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIONS BY THE FMLN,"
COPREFA SAID IN A COMMNIQUE RELEASED TONIGHT.

   THE CHARGES REGARDING THE SEIZURE OF WEAPONS AND MEDICINE HAVE BEEN
RAISED AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ARE PREPARING TO
RESUME THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE UNDER UN SPONSORSHIP, PROBABLY EARLY
NEXT MONTH.

   THE DEPUTY SECURITY MINISTER NOTED THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS
"ONGOING" BUT ADDED THAT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS "HINDER THE
NEGOTIATIONS."

   MONTANO MADE THE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS DURING THE FUNERAL OF OTTO
SORTO MILLA, SON-IN-LAW OF THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE CHIEF (GENERAL
RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA) WHO DIED YESTERDAY, 17 DAYS AFTER AN ATTACK IN
WHICH HE WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND FOR WHICH THE GUERRILLAS CLAIMED
CREDIT.
