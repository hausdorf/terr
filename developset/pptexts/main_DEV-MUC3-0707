 THE SALVADORAN ARMED
FORCES INFORM THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR THAT FMLN  TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN LOOTING AND
ACTS OF VANDALISM IN AREAS AROUND SAN SALVADOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN
UNABLE TO FACE THE ARMY, WHICH DISMANTLED ITS PLAN TO CREATE A STATE
OF REBELLION.

   ACCORDING TO REPORTS, GROUPS OF VANDALS HAVE SACKED SOME SHOPPING
CENTERS, SPECIFICALLY IN SOYAPANGO, SAN SALVADOR DEPARTMENT, AS PART
OF THEIR STRATEGY TO COVER THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FMLN TERRORISTS.

   IN THIS RESPECT, THE ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS ARE COMMITTED TO
RIDDING THE ZONE OF THESE CRIMINAL TERRORISTS WHO SEEK INTERNATIONAL
PUBLICITY FOR THEIR CAUSE.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE MUST BE ASSURED THAT
THEIR ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONDING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER TO THE
TERRORISTS' PROVOCATION, SINCE THE SOLDIERS DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF
THE PEOPLE AND SOCIETY.  FOR THAT REASON, PEOPLE MUST REMAIN CALM.
THE ARMED FORCES REITERATE THEIR CALL ON PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES
SO THEY WILL NOT FALL PREY TO FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS AND TO HEED THE
CURFEW ORDER, WHICH WILL GO INTO EFFECT BEGINNING TODAY FROM 0800
TONIGHT UNTIL 0600 TOMORROW.
