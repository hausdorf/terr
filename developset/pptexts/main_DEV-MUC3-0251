 HURTADO
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THIS MORNING DELIVERED PART OF THE COFFEE TAX,
WHICH WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THE MAYORS' OFFICES IN THE
COUNTRY.  AFTER THE EVENT AT A SAN SALVADOR HOTEL, CRISTIANI ANSWERED
QUESTIONS, FIRST ON THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
 COMMUNIQUE DENYING PARTICIPATION IN THE MURDER OF PRESIDENCY
MINISTER JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH. IN THE COMMUNIQUE, THE FMLN
FLATLY DECLARED THAT NONE OF THEIR MEMBERS HAD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE MURDER.  CRISTIANI HAD THIS TO SAY:

     THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND SAID THEY HAD
NOT ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION AND ADDED THAT APPARENTLY A GROUP GOT OUT OF
HAND AND PERPETRATED THE CRIME.  I THINK THE FMLN HAS REALIZED THE GENERAL
REPUDIATION THIS ACTION HAS ELICITED.  I AM CONVINCED THE FMLN IS TRYING TO
EXCUSE THE ACTION, THUS AVOIDING ALL RESPONSIBILITY.  WE THINK THEY ARE
TRYING TO SEEK A WAY OUT OF THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF AN
AGED, DEFENSELESS PERSON.  BUT THERE IS NO WAY OUT FOR THEM NOW.

    THE FMLN HAS DENIED THAT ANY OF ITS MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE
ACTION.

    OF COURSE, THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO DENY IT AFTER THEY LEARNED
OF THE REPUDIATION BOTH HERE AND ABROAD.  IN ADDITION, THEY WAITED A
CONSIDERABLE TIME TO DENY THEIR PARTICIPATION.  THEY HAD A COMPLETE PLAN
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  AS YOU KNOW, THE PLAN IS CALLED "ALL AGAINST ARENA
."  THIS MURDER WAS PART OF THEIR PLAN.
RODRIGUEZ PORTH HAD NO ENEMIES.  HE WAS A PEACEFUL MAN WHO STRUGGLED WITH
HIS PEN AND IDEAS. ONLY AN IRRATIONAL MIND, LIKE THAT OF THOSE WHO
ADVOCATE VIOLENCE, COULD HAVE CONCEIVED THIS ACTION.  I AM CONVINCED THE
FMLN DID IT.

    MR PRESIDENT, IF YOU AND THE  ARE CONVINCED
THE FMLN IS GUILTY, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE DIALOGUE?

    WE THINK WE SHOULD OVERCOME THE EFFECT OF THIS HEAVY BLOW
CAUSED BY THE LOSS, NOT ONLY OF A COLUMN OF THE PARTY AND OF OUR IDEOLOGY,
BUT ALSO OF A PERSONAL FRIEND.  AS MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE SHOULD
OVERCOME OUR GRIEF AND SEEK THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE  VIOLENCE IS REPUDIATED AND REJECTED IN THE COUNTRY.  IT IS TIME
FOR THE FMLN TO TALK ABOUT ITS OBJECTIVES.  THEY HAVE REJECTED THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH UNACCEPTABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE
ARGUMENTS.  BUT OUR PROPOSAL FOR DIALOGUE IS STILL GOOD.  WE ARE WILLING TO
SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THEM SO THIS VIOLENCE CAN END.

    HAS A COMMISSION ALREADY BEEN FORMED?  

    WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING IT.  SOME OF THE PROPOSED
PERSONS HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO BE MEMBERS.  WE HOPE TO HAVE FORMED THE
COMMISSION BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  AS SOON AS WE HAVE IT, WE WILL GLADLY
ANNOUNCE THE MEMBERS' NAMES.
