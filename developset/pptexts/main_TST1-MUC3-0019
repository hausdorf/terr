 AFTER NEARLY A 2-MONTH ABSENCE FROM THE
NATIONAL PRESS, MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HOLDS THE VIEW THAT THE
ARMED FORCES SHOULD NOT BE CRITICIZED FOR THE ISOLATED BEHAVIOR OF
SOME OF ITS MEMBERS.  THE ARENA 
LEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THE
ONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS' MURDER CASE COULD BE
CLEARED-UP.

     IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION  THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM.  REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITS
MEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR
POLITICAL REASONS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE
ARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THAT
OUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS.  IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE
PASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN
ON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HAD
TO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVE
HAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. 

   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEEN
CLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE
CONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.

     THE JESUITS' CASE WAS A DETERMINING
FACTOR.  BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF
THE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS
IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS.  I DO NOT
BELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLY
AFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN .  FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DID
ARISE , THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN.  I
KNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLE
DISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS.
FOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THE
NEIGHBORHOODS.  WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELY
CAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUM
OF CIVILIANS WOUNDED.  FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE
THINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERE
THEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. 

   THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS
AGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THE
MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHIN
THE PARTY.  D'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE.

     NOT IN THE LEAST.  THERE HAVE NEVER
BEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  ON THE CONTRARY, WE
ARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THE
MAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING.  THIS IS REASON FOR
PRIDE NOT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BUT FOR THE PARTY
AND FRIENDS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. 

   IN COMMENTING ON THE DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, D'AUBUISSON SUPPORTED
PRESIDENT CRITIANI'S INITIATIVE OF ENGAGING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL.

     I DO NOT THINK HE HAS THE TIME TO
ACT AS MEDIATOR; HOWEVER, HE COULD ACT AS A GUARANTOR, RECEIVING
RESULTS OF THESE TALKS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS
MADE. 

   MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, CURRENTLY AN ARENA DEPUTY, SAID THAT THIS
YEAR HE WILL DEDICATE HIS TIME TO EXPAND AND REORGANIZE THE PARTY TO
GET READY FOR THE 1991 MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE WILL
MOST LIKELY NOT BE AN ARENA DEPUTY IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE PERIOD,
BECAUSE HE, ALONG WITH OTHER FORMER LEGISLATORS, WILL CONCENTRATE
THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT.
