 VICE PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MERINO SAYS THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE HURTING THEMSELVES BY
CARRYING OUT ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ONE PERPETRATED RECENTLY.  HE SAID
THE REBELS ARE ACTING LIKE OSTRICHES BY HIDING THEIR HEADS UNDER THE
SAND.

     LOGICALLY THAT IS NO SOLUTION. THEY MUST
REALIZE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM.  THE PEOPLE CONDEMN ALL OF
THESE ACTIONS.  THE LATEST ATTACKS ARE HURTING THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT  ITSELF.  THEY HAVE BEEN ISOLATED
INTERNATIONALLY, THE PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THEM, AND THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE ARMY ARE FULFULLING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE.  THEREFORE, THEY
MUST CONTINUE WITH THE TALKS AND PARTICIPATE IN THEM SERIOUSLY BY
REACHING AGREEMENTS THAT CAN BRING PEACE TO ALL. THE TERRORIST
AGGRESSION MAKES NO SENSE.

    WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION?  WILL IT CONTINUE
WITH THE TALKS?  WILL IT GO TO THE TALKS EVEN IF THE GUERRILLA
COMMANDERS DO NOT ATTEND?

    THE GOVERNMENT DEFINITELY HAS A COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE.
IT IS A COMMITMENT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE.  BESIDES OUR WILLINGNESS
TO ACHIEVE PEACE WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO THESE TALKS.  WE WILL
CONTINUE ON THIS ROAD.  IT IS CERTAINLY A DIFFICULT ROAD BUT WE MUST
CONTINUE ON IT.  I BELIEVE THAT THE SAN JOSE MEETING LIKE THE ONE IN
CARACAS, AND MAYBE OTHERS AFTER THAT, HAS BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE DISCUSSED ALL THE PROBLEMS AND THE GUERRILLAS WILL
LOGICALLY REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE
TABLE.

    THEY ASK FOR GUARANTEES FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.

    I BELIEVE WE CANNOT GIVE THEM MORE GUARANTEES THAN THE
ONES WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THEM.  THERE IS A GENERAL FEELING THAT
THESE PEOPLE ONLY UNDERSTAND STRONG ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS REVIEWED THE SITUATION QUITE WELL, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL
INTO THAT TRAP OR MAKE THAT MISTAKE.  OTHERWISE, WE WOULD GIVE THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL LOGICALLY BE
PRUDENT.  

   VICE PRESIDENT MERINO SAID THAT DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES THE
GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE.  THE FMLN
GUERRILLAS WITHDREW FROM THE TALKS AND DEMANDED SECURITY FOR LABOR
UNION ORGANIZATIONS FOLLOWING THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS
, IN WHICH 10 LABOR
UNION MEMBERS WERE KILLED, INCLUDING OPPOSITION LEADER ELIZABETH
VELAZQUEZ.

   NEXT WEEK, GUERRILLA LEADERS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA WITH
PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS TO SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THE COMPLEX SITUATION IN EL
SALVADOR.
