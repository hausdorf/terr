  
 THE ARMY CARRIED OUT A LARGE BOMB ATTACK ON
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR IN AN EFFORT TO WEAKEN OUR POSITIONS.   THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A VICTORY THERE.  BUT
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT, ASIDE FROM ALL THE PROPAGANDA THEY USED AND
THE PLAN TO WEAKEN US MILITARILY, THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED UNION
OFFICES AND THE HOMES OF LEADERS OF POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS
SECTORS.  APPARENTLY, EVERYONE HAD GONE INTO HIDING AND THEY ONLY
FOUND THE WIFE OF A UNIVERSITY LEADER AND THEY KILLED HER.  THEY ALSO
FOUND THE JESUITS.  IT SEEMS THAT IN VIEW OF RECENT TALKS WITH
CRISTIANI, FATHER ELLACURIA HAD BECOME VERY TRUSTING.  HE THOUGHT THAT
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM.   THIS
SITUATION SO THEY DID NOT PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THE FACE OF THE DANGER
OF A POSSIBLE ACTION SUCH AS THIS CRIME.

   ON THE SAME NIGHT WHEN THE ENTIRE NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AREA WAS
BEING BOMBED, THE JESUITS WERE KILLED.  WHAT WAS THEIR INTENTION?
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TO OBTAIN A MILITARY VICTORY AND SET OUT TO
CARRY OUT A WITCH HUNT.  THEY SET OUT TO KILL ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS
THAT ONE NIGHT, WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WIPE OUT THE
FMLN, MILITARILY.  BASED ON THAT ASSUMPTION, THEY DECIDED TO CARRY OUT
THIS ACTION TO GUARANTEE FOR THEMSELVES A FEW MORE YEARS OF STABILITY
THROUGH THE PEACE OF CEMETERIES, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

   WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?  THE DAY AFTER THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME, THEY
LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN.  THEY THOUGHT THIS
WAS GOING TO BE THEIR DECISIVE DAY, BUT THE OFFENSIVE FAILED.  THEIR
ATTACK WAS REPELLED, THEY SUSTAINED MANY CASUALTIES, AND LOSS MUCH
MATERIEL.  THEIR TROOPS WERE FURTHER BEATEN AND THEY DID NOT OBTAIN
ANY EFFECTIVE MILITARY RESULTS.

   CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR COUNTEROFFENSIVE WAS REJECTED AND THE BLOW THEY
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT
FAILED, ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE SOME OF THESE LEADERS WERE HIDING AND
ON THE OTHER BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED AN HORRENDOUS CRIME AND IT
BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A CRIME  BY THE GENERAL STAFF AND
MR. CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT.  CRISTIANI CLEARLY  AND
PROBABLY EVEN THE U.S. EMBASSY COULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS.  THEY
THOUGHT THAT BY KILLING ALL OPPOSITION MEMBERS, THEY WERE GOING TO
ACHIEVE DEFINITE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  THIS IS VERY CLEAR.  BUT THIS
ACTION BACKFIRED.  IT WAS A PAINFUL INCIDENT, BUT IT IS AN INCIDENT
THAT IS GOING TO BACKFIRE FOR THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS GOING TO RESULT
IN GREAT ISOLATION FOR THE REGIME, AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN IS
STRONGER.  AT A MOMENT WHEN THE FMLN HAS A POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE.

   THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS IS SUICIDE FOR THE REGIME.  I REALLY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND IT.  THEY MADE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE.  IN ADDITION,
THEY CONFIRMED A TRUTH WE HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING: THEY ARE FASCISTS AND
ASSASSINS.  THEY MUST LEAVE POWER.  THEY HAVE CREATED A SITUATION IN
WHICH THE POSSIBILITY FOR AN FMLN VICTORY IS GREAT.  THEY HAVE CREATED
A SITUATION IN WHICH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE
OLIGARCHIC SECTORS OF THE SALVADORAN SOCIETY WILL BE CAUSED BY THEIR
OWN MISTAKES.
