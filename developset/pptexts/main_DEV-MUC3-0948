INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE TO DETERMINE WHO PLACED A CAR BOMB IN FRONT OF THE
DAS  FACILITIES.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS DIRECTOR, A SPANISH TERRORIST AND ETA  MEMBER WHO COULD HAVE ADVISED THE
COLOMBIANS ON THE PREPARATION OF THE CAR BOMB HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.

   DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF
HIS SUBORDINATES AND FELLOW WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF AN
EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF THE DAS FACILITIES.  AT THE END OF THE RELIGIOUS
CEREMONY, GEN MAZA SAID THAT HE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT
FOREIGN TERRORISTS PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE.

     THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THIS COULD BE SO,
BECAUSE THE METHODS AND SYSTEM USED TO FABRICATE THE CAR BOMB LEAD US TO
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE EXPERTS IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY.  

   GEN MAZA, WITH SADNESS IN HIS EYES, ADDED THAT HE WILL CONTINUE
WORKING IN THE SAME OFFICE WHERE THE ATTACK OCCURRED.
