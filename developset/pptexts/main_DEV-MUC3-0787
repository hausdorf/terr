 ON
THE 7TH DAY OF THE OFFENSIVE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT  HAS TAKEN A STRATEGIC TURN IN THE WAR, AS WE BEGIN TO
STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN A NEW AND DEFINITE SCENARIO OF OPERATIONS IN THE
CITIES, WITH THE INSURRECTIONAL PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE SEEKING TO
ACHIEVE PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  THE FIGHTING WAGED IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN
MIGUEL, USULUTAN, ZACATECOLUCA, SANTA ANA, AND OTHER PARTS IN THE
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE LEADING ROLE PLAYED BY THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED AND JOINED THE STRUGGLE.

   THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE EXPOSED THE MILITARY FASCIST
DICTATORSHIP TO THE EYES OF THE WORLD.  THE DICTATORSHIP HAS REMOVED
ITS CIVILIAN MASK, AND IT HAS SHOWN ITS BARBARIC NATURE AS IT BOMBED
CITIES AND MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS, WHO WERE MEMBERS OF A NATIONAL
CONSCIENCE THAT IS SEEKING SOCIAL CHANGES AND PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.

   THESE CRIMES COMMITTED BY CRISTIANI AND COLONEL PONCE  DEFINITELY ISOLATE
THEM FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH CONDEMNS THEM AND RECALLS THE
LAST DAYS OF SOMOZA.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE U.S.  CONGRESS DISCUSSES
CUTTING MILITARY AID TO THE REGIME.  THE 7 DAYS OF OUR OFFENSIVE HAVE
LED TO IRREVERSIBLE ACHIEVEMENTS.  THE REGIME HAS BEEN DEFEATED IN THE
POLITICAL FIELD AND FATALY WOUNDED IN THE MILITARY FIELD.

   IN 7 DAYS OF COMBAT IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THE HIGH COMMAND LOST ITS
LAST DEFENSIVE LINE.  OUR FORCES ARE HITTING HARD AT THEIR TIRED
HEART.  VICTORY IS A FACT THAT NO ONE CAN ALTER.

   IN THE OFFENSIVE, WE KILLED OR WOUNDED AN ESTIMATED 827 TROOPS AND
OFFICERS.  WE SEIZED 127 LONG WEAPONS, 21 MACHINEGUNS AND SUPPORT
WEAPONS, AS WELL AS ABOUT 80,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION OF VARIOUS
CALIBERS.  WE HAVE CONFIRMED REPORTS THAT WE HAVE DAMAGED 11 AIRCRAFT
AND DESTROYED 27 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS.

   THE HUMILIATING DEFEAT OF THE HIGH COMMAND IS EVIDENT IN A
DEPRESSED COL PONCE, WHO NO LONGER SPEAKS OF THE GUERRILLAS IN POCKETS
ALONG THE BORDER.  INSTEAD, HE SPEAKS IN FRONT OF A MAP OF THE CAPITAL
CITY, POINTING OUT THE PRESENCE AND ADVANCE OF THE FMLN.

   VARIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS OF EL SALVADOR HAVE INITIATED
EFFORTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS IN ORDER TO
FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT THAT WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR AND BRING ABOUT
THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE COUNTRY.  THE FMLN LOOKS FAVORABLY ON THESE
EFFORTS, AND IT HAS ALREADY ACTIVELY JOINED THESE NATIONAL SECTORS WHO
ARE OPPOSED TO THE GENOCIDE BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE HIGH COMMAND IN A
SUICIDAL ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE WAR THAT IT HAS TURNED INTO A
BUSINESS DEAL.

   THE GENERAL COMMAND RECOGNIZES THE HEROISM OF OUR FIGHTERS AND
CALLS ON THEM TO CONTINUE ADVANCING ALONG WITH OUR REBELS IN THE FINAL
CHAPTER OF THIS HISTORY.

    THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, 17 NOVEMBER 1989
