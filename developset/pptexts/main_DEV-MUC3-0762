 IN VIEW OF THE SINISTER MASSACRE OF
JESUIT PRIESTS TODAY, THE FMLN REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE:

   1.  THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, SEGUNDO
MONTES, IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ, AMANDO LOPEZ, AND JUAN
RAMON MORENO, ALONG WITH MRS JULIA ELBA RAMOS AND HER DAUGHTER CELINA
RAMOS, WAS PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES DEATH SQUADS AT DAWN TODAY.

   A GROUP OF ABOUT 30 MEN DRESSED IN GREEN STORMED INTO THE PRIESTS'
RESIDENCE AND RIDDLED THEM WITH BULLETS FIRED FROM HEAVY CALIBER
WEAPONS.  THREE OF THE BODIES WERE DRAGGED OUT TO THE PATIO WHERE THEY
WERE GIVEN DEATH BLOWS THAT COMPLETELY CRUSHED THEIR SKULLS.

   2.  THIS ABSURD MASSACRE AND THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS AGAINST HEAVILY
POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND, AND ARE PART OF
A COUNTERINSURGENT PLAN TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND CREATE
A STATE OF TERROR AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  PUBLIC DEATH THREATS
WERE MADE AGAINST PRIEST IGNACIO ELLACURIA OVER THE ARMED FORCES
NATIONAL NETWORK.

   THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY, 15 NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY CORPS SEARCHED
THE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION GROUPS LOOKING FOR THE LEADERS IN ORDER
TO KILL THEM.  THIS IS THE SAME SCHEME THEY USED IN 1979 AND 1980 WHEN
THEY MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND MASSACRED THE REVOLUTIONARY
DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR FELIX ULLOA, AND TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.

   3.  THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE ARENA  REGIME AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE
FASCIST BEASTS THAT HAVE BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO PROTEST SUCH AN
UNFORTUNATE MASSACRE, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ISOLATE
THE FASCIST REGIME OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   4.  WE CALL ON THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS WHO KNEW FATHER IGNACIO
ELLACURIA -- AND RESPECTED HIM FOR HIS PAST HISTORY IN THE FIELDS OF
EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE TRUE SITUATION --
TO TAKE A DIGNIFIED AND DETERMINED STAND AND NOT STAIN THEIR HANDS
WITH THE BLOOD OF GENOCIDE.

   THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST PATRIOTS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO DO
NOT HAVE TO SINK WITH THE CRIMINALS.  WE OFFER THEM OUR HANDS, SO THAT
TOGETHER WE WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY, AND SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE
PART OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES
ASSASSINATED THE JESUIT PRIESTS, BUT THEY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE.

   5.  THE FMLN CONDEMNS THIS CRIME AND JOINS IN THE SORROW OF THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO LOSE IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER SOME OF THE MOST
APPRECIATED INTELLECTUALS OF OUR COUNTRY.  THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND
SENSIBILITY WERE ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN OUR
SOCIETY.  THEIR WORK WILL BE ETERNAL, AND THE FASCIST IRRATIONALITY
WILL NEVER PUT AN END TO THAT WORK.

   WE CALL ALL OF OUR COMMANDS, FIGHTERS, MILITANTS, AND OUR PEOPLE IN
GENERAL, TO UNTIRING COMBAT.  THIS STRUGGLE IS THE ONLY ANSWER WE HAVE
FOR THIS DESPICABLE MASSACRE.  WE MUST OUST ARENA AND LA TANDONA .  THE
FATHERLAND IS COUNTING ON OUR STRENGTH AND OUR DETERMINATION, AND WE
WILL NOT FAIL THE FATHERLAND.

    FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDER SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL,
COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, COMMANDER FRANCISCO JOVEL, COMMANDER
SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO
