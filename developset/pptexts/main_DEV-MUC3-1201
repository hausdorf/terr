 OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE
REPORTED THAT FIVE POLICEMEN AND A CIVILIAN WERE KILLED, AND AT LEAST
24 SOLDIERS INJURED WHEN A VEHICLE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES EXPLODED ON
2 APRIL NEAR A POLICE PRECINCT LOCATED ON THE SOUTHWESTERN OUTSKIRTS
OF SAN SALVADOR.

   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) CONFIRMED THAT THE
TERRORIST ATTACK OCCURRED AT 0615 (1315 GMT)  ON MONDAY
IN SANTA TECLA, 12 KM FROM THE CAPITAL.

   THE OFFICIAL REPORT REVEALS THAT A COMPANY OF POLICEMEN FROM THE

WAS EXERCISING NEAR THE PRECINCT WHEN A POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE CHARGE IN A
PICK-UP TRUCK WENT OFF AS THE POLICEMAN WENT BY.  A COPREFA SPOKESMAN
HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PROBABLY ACTIVATED BY REMOTE
CONTROL BY A GUERRILLA UNIT.
