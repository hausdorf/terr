WE CONDEMN GUATEMALAN INTERVENTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE URNG GENERAL
COMMAND EXPRESSES ITS STRONG SOLIDARITY AND DEEP ADMIRATION FOR THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEIR VANGUARD, THE FMLN , WHO WITH GREAT HEROISM AND DETERMINATION
ARE WRITING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PAGES OF ITS HISTORY.

   WE VIEW WITH PROFOUND INDIGNATION HOW THE OFFICERS OF LA TANDONA
 AND THE ARENA  GOVERNMENT
HEADED BY CRISTIANI, IN VIEW OF THEIR INABILITY TO DEFEAT, REPEL, OR CONTAIN
THE HEROIC FMLN, HAVE DECIDED TO CONTINUE MASSIVE BOMBINGS AGAINST
DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS, SOW DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, AND COMMIT MASSACRES.

   THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH ARE
DESPERATE DUE TO THE VICTORIOUS ADVANCES OF THE FMLN FORCES -- WHICH
HAVE NOT ONLY MAINTAINED, BUT EXPANDED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR
AND THE REST OF THE TERRITORY OF THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY -- HAVE LOST
CONTROL.

   WITH VENGEANCE IN THEIR MINDS, THEY HAVE BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT A
NUMBER OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST ALL THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH THE JUST
STRUGGLES OF THE MAJORITY.  AT DAWN ON 16 NOVEMBER, SIX JESUIT PRIESTS
AND TWO HUMBLE WOMEN WHO WORKED FOR THEM WERE BRUTALLY ASSASSINATED.
WE SHARE THE GREAT SORROW OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY
OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND ADD OUR PROTEST TO THOSE OF OTHERS THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD WHO HAVE ALREADY PROTESTED THESE DESPICABLE ASSASSINATIONS.

   THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS INCIDENT AND URGES
ALL GUATEMALANS AND ALL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND RELIGIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS TO SPEAK OUT IN THE FACE OF THESE GENOCIDAL AND BARBARIC
ACTIONS THAT ARE ONLY COMPARABLE TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES DID IN
VIETNAM AND THE NAZIS DID IN WORLD WAR II.

   IN OUR 13 NOVEMBER STATEMENT, WE DENOUNCED THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S
INTERVENTIONIST PLANS AGAINST THAT FRATERNAL COUNTRY.  ON 15 NOVEMBER,
PRESS AGENCIES REPORTED THAT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY HAD DEPLOYED 126
UNITS OF THE SPECIAL KAIBILES  TROOPS, WHO
ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR PATHOLOGICAL SAVAGERY.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE COMMANDER OF THE MILITARY STAFF, AND THE
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMED FORCES HAVE PUBLICLY
EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH CRISTIANI AND THE SALVADORAN ARMY.  WE
CONDEMN WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH THE GUATEMALAN ARMY'S INTERVENTION AMONG
THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

   WE CALL ON ALL SEGMENTS OF THE GUATEMALAN POPULATION TO EXPRESS
THEIR OPPOSITION AGAINST THIS INTERVENTION.  WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE
GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY FOR THEIR AGGRESSION AGAINST
THE FRATERNAL SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE ADVISE THE WORLD THAT EL SALVADOR
MIGHT FACE AN EVEN WORSE GENOCIDE THAN THE ONE IT IS CURRENTLY
ENDURING.  WE ARE SURE THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT ALL
THEIR ENEMIES, WIN THIS HISTORIC STRUGGLE, AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS.
THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED WILL BREED NEW LIFE AND WILL UNDOUBTELY
LEAD US TO FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 17 NOVEMBER 1989

   URNG GENERAL COMMAND

   COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, PABLO MONSANTO, GASPAR ILOM, AND CARLOS
GONZALEZ, PGT  SECRETARY GENERAL
