  AND, THEREFORE, IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT IS A
TOTAL ADVANCEMENT IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT
VERY DEMOCRATIC TO HAVE THE ARMED FORCES OF A COUNTRY UNDER THE
CONTROL OF ONE OF ITS POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE ARMED FORCES OF A
COUNTRY SHOULD RESPOND TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND TO THE GOVERNMENT
THAT IS LEGITIMATELY ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.  AND THEREFORE, THIS WOULD
CURTAIL THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE IN TRYING TO
CONTROL AND GOVERN THE COUNTRY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT FROM THE
POSITION OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY.  SECONDLY, I THINK THAT I
HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT
WILL CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH
NICARAGUA, BUT RATHER THE ATTITUDE OF THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH
RESPECT TO AID TO THE FMLN, TO THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.
AND IN THIS CASE WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CHANGE TAKING PLACE.
OBVIOUSLY, WE FEEL THAT WITH MRS CHAMORRO AS PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA
THAT THIS AID WILL STOP AND THEREFORE MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE
RESUMPTION OF NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, BUT
IT IS THAT ATTITUDE THAT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE
RESULT IN ITSELF.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT IF MRS
CHAMORRO REALLY IS IN CONTROL, IN TOTAL CONTROL, ESPECIALLY OF THE
SANDINISTA ARMY, THAT THERE WILL BE A STOP IN AID, AND THEREFORE THE
FMLN WOULD NOT HAVE NICARAGUA'S LOGISTICAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR
THEM.  AND THEREFORE, THIS CERTAINLY AFFECTS THEM.

    I THINK THAT ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO OR TWO WEEKS
AGO IN THE WASHINGTON POST THERE WAS A REPORT THAT COLONEL BENAVIDES
WAS LIVING A RATHER LUXURIOUS LIFE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN
THAT PIECE.  AND ALSO THE U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER HAS SAID THAT
HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME THAT, WELL, THE ARTICLE IMPLIES THAT THERE
WAS SOME PRESSURE, OR THERE WAS SOME PROTECTION COMING FROM THE
TANDONA  TO PROTECT BENAVIDES, BECAUSE HE
 THEIR MEN AND THAT SOME LOWER LIEUTENANTS WERE NOT
GOING TO BE RECEIVING ANY SORT OF PROTECTION AND THEY MAY HAVE TO TAKE
THE FAULT FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  AND ALSO WILLIAM WALKER HAD SAID
THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TANDONA TO
STEP DOWN AND FOR OTHER OFFICERS TO MOVE UP.  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT ?  SHOULD THERE BE THAT KIND OF PRESSURE?
SHOULD SOME OF THE GUYS IN THE TANDONA STEP DOWN FROM THEIR POSTS?

    WELL, I THINK THAT IT IS NOT REALLY THE
DETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER YOU BELONG TO A SPECIFIC GRADUATING CLASS
WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES THAT SHOULD BE WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU
CONTINUE OR NOT, OR BE REMOVED OR NOT FROM THE ARMED FORCES.  IT IS
YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE AND YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR THAT SHOULD BE THE
DETERMINING FACTOR.

   SO, THEREFORE, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE TANDONA PEOPLE, JUST
FOR BEING MEMBERS OF THE GRADUATING CLASS,  THAT ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM.  SO I THINK THAT IN THAT CASE THAT IS
NOT REALLY THE POINT.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER CASE, I THINK IT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY ON HOW IT GOES, WHAT TYPE OF
DEFENSE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ARRAIGNED HAVE.  I THINK THAT THEY ALL
ARE RECEIVING THE LEGAL SUPPORT IN THE CASE AND THE OTHER .

    AS FOR THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS,
BEFORE YOU LEFT FOR TAIWAN YOU CONDITIONED THE DIALOGUE ON A CEASING
OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  TO BE SPECIFIC, DOES THIS MEAN  ALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE?  AND ALSO, WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT
THIS DIALOGUE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE?

    WELL, IF WE COULD TRY AND PUT INTO ONE
BASKET AND CALL THAT BASKET WITH A NAME WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS,
WE ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE TERRORIST
ACTIVITY IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  YOU JUST MENTIONED THE
FACT ABOUT A POLE THAT THEY USE FOR ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE
COUNTRY.  JUST LAST NIGHT THEY BLEW UP ONE AND THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
HURT.  TWO CIVILIANS THAT WERE PASSING BY WERE HURT BY THAT EXPLOSION.
SO THAT IS WHAT HAS TO STOP.  THE FMLN HAS TO STOP ALL TERRORIST
ACTIVITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT HURTS THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.  THAT IS NOT MILITARY ACTIVITY.  THAT IS SOMETHING GEARED
AGAINST OR TO CONFRONT THE ARMED FORCES.  SO IT IS THAT VIOLENCE THAT
CAN BE SUMMED UP IN WHAT IS CALLED TERRORISM THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR --
THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF THE
COUNTRY.
