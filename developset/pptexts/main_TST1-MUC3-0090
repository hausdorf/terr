 A BOMB WENT OFF THIS
MORNING NEAR A POWER TOWER IN SAN SALVADOR LEAVING A LARGE PART OF THE
CITY WITHOUT ENERGY, BUT NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL SOURCES, THE BOMB -- ALLEGEDLY DETONATED BY
URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS -- BLEW UP A POWER TOWER IN THE NORTHWESTERN
PART OF SAN SALVADOR AT 0650 (1250 GMT).

   ON FRIDAY, 16 MARCH, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
(FMLN) DECREED A SUSPENSION OF ITS ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS AND OF ITS SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST MEANS OF
TRANSPORTATION, BUSINESSES, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

   THAT DECISION, AIMED AT CREATING THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR A
NEW ROUND OF TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ENERGY
SYSTEM OR ARMED FORCES' MEMBERS AND INSTALLATIONS.
