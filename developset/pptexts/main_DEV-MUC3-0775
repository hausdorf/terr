 WE RECENTLY HEARD
U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER ON A SALVADORAN TELEVISION NEWSCAST.  HE SAID
NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHO HAD PLANNED THE MURDER OF FATHER IGNACIO ELLACURIA
AND THE OTHER JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS TELLS WILLIAM WALKER THAT HIS CYNICISM IS BEYOND
THE LIMIT.  WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHICH GENERAL STAFF
OFFICE ISSUED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUIT PRIESTS.

   WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS THAT ON THE NIGHT OF 11 NOVEMBER RADIO
CUSCATLAN URGED THE PEOPLE TO ASSASSINATE IGNACIO ELLACURIA, RUBEN
ZAMORA, AND DOCTOR GUILLERMO UNGO.  THE WHOLE WORLD....  THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA HAS FEATURED THE RECORDING IN WHICH
RADIO CUSCATLAN -- THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF'S RADIO, MEANING THE
RADIO CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF, THE RADIO IN WHICH
NOT A SINGLE WORD, NOT A SINGLE COMMA GOES OUT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF
THE CENSORS WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON RADIO CUSCATLAN - -  DEATH.

   THEREFORE, WILLIAM WALKER KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHERE THE ORDER CAME
FROM; HE KNOWS THE EXACT TIME THAT 40 UNIFORMED MEN LEFT IN  CURFEW, A FEW BLOCKS FROM COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE'S
OFFICE.  WILLIAM WALKER'S CYNICISM WENT BEYOND THE LIMIT WHEN HE SAID
THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW  OR WHO PLANNED IGNACIO
ELLACURIA'S ASSASSINATION.

   WILLIAM WALKER IS DOING A HISTORICAL IMITATION OF THE FILIBUSTER
WHO CAME TO CENTRAL AMERICA IN 1856 TO SUBJUGATE OUR PEOPLE AND BECOME
PRESIDENT OF A CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION, MEANING NICARAGUA, WHO DECREED
THAT ENGLISH BE THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, AND THAT THE U.S.  FLAG BECOME
THE OCCUPATION FORCES' FLAG.  WILIAM WALKER IS RE- EDITING A SHAMEFUL
CHAPTER IN CENTRAL AMERICA'S HISTORY.  WILLIAM WALKER, THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR IN OUR HOMELAND, IS RE-EDITING -- IN THE FORM OF A
CARICATURE -- A HISTORICAL EVENT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE 19TH CENTURY.
HOWEVER, WE WANT TO TELL SOMETHING TO THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO HAS
BEEN FEATURED IN PRESS AND TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS GIVING FIGURES
WHICH DIFFER EVEN FROM THOSE GIVEN BY COL PONCE; THE NEW WILLIAM
WALKER, WHO THINKS HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND IS BETTER THAN
CRISTIANI AND COL PONCE, SO HE GIVES INVENTED FIGURES ON GUERRILLA
CASUALTIES; THE NEW WILLIAM WALKER, WHO EVALUATES THE NATION'S
POLITICAL AND MILITARY SITUATION, EVEN BEFORE CRISTIANI AND PONCE DO
SO, EVEN CONTRADICTING COL PONCE'S FIGURES.  WILLIAM WALKER SAID 40
MEMBERS OF THE FMLN  WERE
CAPTURED, YET THE BLEARY-EYED COL PONCE LAST NIGHT TALKED ABOUT 9 FMLN
MEMBERS.  WHERE, THEN, ARE THE REST OF THE CAPTURED FMLN FIGHTERS?

   HUMANITARIAN GROUPS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THAT CONTRADICTION
BETWEEN PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE.  RED
CROSS INTERNATIONAL, GREEN CROSS, AND AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL MUST
DEMAND THAT WILLIAM WALKER SAY WHERE THE CAPTURED GUERRILLA FIGHTERS
ARE, BECAUSE COL PONCE ONLY MENTIONS NINE FIGHTERS.  COL PONCE TALKS
ABOUT NINE AND THE OTHER ONE TALKS ABOUT DOZENS.  THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN
PRESIDENT WILLIAM WALKER AND HIS SUBORDINATE, COL PONCE.  WHERE ARE
THE OTHER CAPTURED FIGHTERS?  MOST OF THEM WERE SURELY CIVILIANS WHO
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONFLICT.  THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN
THE WAR ZONES AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE MEDIA AS DEAD GUERRILLA
FIGHTERS.

   WE DEMAND, BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THAT AMBASSADOR
WILLIAM WALKER CLEARLY SAY HOW COL PONCE COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN WHEN
ADMITTING THAT ONLY NINE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS WERE CAPTURED -- WHILE THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR PERSONALLY REVEALED THE FIGURES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
REVEALED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI A LONG TIME AGO -- EVEN IF THEY WERE
IMAGINARY FIGURES.  WILLIAM WALKER MUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION: WHERE
ARE THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS?
