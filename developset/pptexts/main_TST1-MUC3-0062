 THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION
(ELN) HAS ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR,
GOVERNOR OF THE NORTHWESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, THAT IT REJECTS THE
PEACE PLAN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ARMED
ATTACKS, IT WAS LEARNED A FEW HOURS AGO.

   ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, THE ARMED MOVEMENT--THE MOST RADICAL
OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY--SENT THE MESSAGE THROUGH LUIS
MESA PUERTA, A POLICE INSPECTOR OF EL TIGRE, WHO WAS KIDNAPED LAST
FRIDAY FOR THIS PURPOSE.

   ROLDAN BETANCUR DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY MORE DETAILS AND MERELY
CONFIRMED THAT THE CASTROITE ELN, WHICH HAS STAGED SEVERAL DYNAMITE
ATTACKS AGAINST OIL INSTALLATIONS, DID NOT ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL MADE BY
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS' GOVERNMENT.

   MEANWHILE, THE M-19 SENT A LETTER A FEW HOURS AGO TO MISAEL
PASTRANA BORRERO, A FORMER PRESIDENT AND MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY (PSC), REQUESTING THAT HIS PARTY ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATE IN A NEW PEACE INITIATIVE THAT FORMALLY BEGAN THE 2D WEEK
OF JANUARY.

   AT THAT TIME, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA--THE
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE--AND THE TOP M-19 COMMANDER, CARLOS
PIZARRO LEON GOMEZ, SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THAT CONTEMPLATES
THE BEGINNING OF A DIRECT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLA GROUPS AND
SPOKESMEN OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT.

   HOWEVER, THE FARC, WHICH DECLARED A UNILATERAL TRUCE TO FACILIATE
THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATIONS, SAID THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WERE
"EXCLUSIVE," AS THEY WERE SIGNED BY ONLY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S REBEL
MOVEMENTS.

   THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SPECIFIES THAT
THE TASKS WITH ALL THE REBEL ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE
SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNGSB).  HOWEVER,
WITH THE ELN ANNOUNCEMENT, A JOINT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RULED OUT.

   MEANWHILE, PRIOR TO LEAVING TODAY FOR CARACAS WHERE HE WILL ATTEND
THE INAUGURATION OF CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, THE PRESIDENT HELD A MEETING
WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES, FORMER PRESIDENTS
JULIO CESAR TURBAY OF THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, AND PASTRANA BORRERO,
OF THE PSC.

   THE MEETING HELD AT THE NARINO PALACE (SEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT) WAS
CALLED SO THAT BARCO VARGAS COULD REPORT TO THE PSC ON THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE MOST RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE NEW PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN
WITH THE M-19.

   ACCORDING TO SOME POLITICAL CIRCLES, IN THIS MANNER THE PATH TOWARD
PEACE MIGHT BE CLEARED, INASMUCH AS ONE OF THE "RESERVATIONS" THE PSC
HAD WAS THAT THE BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE
PARTIES ON THE NEGOTIATIONS.
