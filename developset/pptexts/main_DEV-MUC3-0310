 THE
SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT UNIDENTIFIED MEN
SET OFF BOMBS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN JOSE SIMEON CANAS UNIVERSITY,
UCA, LOCATED IN SOUTHWESTERN SAN SALVADOR.

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT 0200.  ONE
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, ONE BUS, AND ONE ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMER WERE DAMAGED
AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION OF AT LEAST FOUR BOMBS THAT WENT OFF INSIDE THE
UCA CAMPUS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS CONDEMNED THIS KIND OF ATTACK, WHICH IS
USUALLY CARRIED OUT BY CERTAIN GROUPS THAT OPPOSE PEACE. THE ARMED FORCES
BELIEVE THAT SUCH ATTACKS ARE NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND
POLITICAL PROBLEMS.

   IN ADDITION, THESE VIOLENT ACTIONS ONLY CONFUSE THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE
UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE ALWAYS BLAME THE ARMY FOR ANY SUCH ACTION, WITHOUT FIRST
CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE ATTACKS.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS REITERATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENSURE
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE LIFE AND
SAFETY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, FROM THIS VERY MOMENT, THE
ARMED FORCES REJECT ANY ACCUSATION IMPLICATING THEM IN THE ATTACK AGAINST
UCA, WHICH TOOK PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING.
