  COMRADE
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS ON STATEMENTS BY THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR IN SAN SALVADOR, WILLIAM WALKER, WHO SAID THAT DESPITE THE
BOMBINGS HIS GOVERNMENT, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, WILL CONTINUE GIVING
MILITARY AID AND SUPPORT TO THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, IT
SEEMS THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
JESUITS.  AT THIS MOMENT, HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES PERCEIVE THE NEW
SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?

    AT THE LEVEL OF THE U.S. PEOPLE, THERE IS A TOTAL
REPUDIATION OF THE FASCIST CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT AND OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMED FORCES BECAUSE OF THE BOMBINGS -- WHICH HAVE BECOME A TRUE
GENOCIDE -- IN VARIOUS DENSELY POPULATED CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN
EL SALVADOR, AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF THE ASSASSINATIONS PERPETRATED BY
THE SALVADORAN ARMY AGAINST THE JESUIT PRIESTS AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY .  THERE HAVE BEEN VERY RADICAL DEMONSTRATIONS
EXPRESSING MUCH INDIGNATION BY VARIOUS U.S. SOCIAL SECTORS.  MOREOVER,
IN SOME OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS, THE POLICE BARRICADES WERE BROKEN.
IMPORTANT U.S. POLITICAL PERSONALITIES SUCH AS JESSE JACKSON, ONE OF
THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICIPATED IN THE
DEMONSTRATIONS.  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS IN BOSTON,
CHICAGO, NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, AND LOS ANGELES.  IN AT LEAST 20
CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED ALL THEIR
REPUDIATION AND INDIGNATION OVER THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S.
POLICY IN EL SALVADOR.

   SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF THE UCA PRIESTS, A LARGE NUMBER OF
IMPORTANT U.S. SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ARE SAYING THAT U.S.
MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE
CUT AND SUSPENDED.  SENATOR KENNEDY IN PARTICULAR MADE A VERY STRONG
STATEMENT, SAYING THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' ATTITUDE SIMPLY
EXPRESSES THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF U.S. POLICY -- WHICH HAS BEEN
SPENT FEEDING, TRAINING, ARMING, AND FINANCING AN ARMED FORCE THAT
CARRIES OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO SENATOR KENNEDY, THERE ARE
MANY U.S. SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE REQUESTING THE TOTAL
SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  AT THIS TIME, THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF
REPUDIATION IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT,  THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE
WHITE HOUSE CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE  CRIMINAL
REGIME AND GIVING IT FURTHER EMERGENCY AID.

    COMRADE, YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT ARTICLES PUBLISHED
IN THE MAIN U.S. NEWSPAPERS THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON
POST, WHICH STRONGLY QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT, SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI, THE CHIEF OF THE FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.  WHAT IS THE
SITUATION OF THE CRISTIANI SPEECH AND HIS ALLEGED LEGITIMACY, NOT ONLY
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?

    THE ALLEGED LEGITIMACY OF CRISTIANI COLLAPSED.  IN THE
UNITED STATES, THEY SAID CRISTIANI WAS  HAD GOOD
INTENTIONS, BUT THE RIGHT-WING  AND THE DEATH SQUADS
DID NOT LET HIM WORK.  THE SPEECH FAILED BECAUSE IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT
AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES, CRISTIANI IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE GENOCIDE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY
.  THE MEDIA HAVE ALSO REPORTED THE ARREST OF U.S.
RELIGIOUS MEN AND OF SWISS, FRENCH, SPANISH, AND JAPANESE CITIZENS.
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT ACCUSING EVERYONE OF
COOPERATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS, AND THIS HAS CAUSED A TOTAL LOSS OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S PRESTIGE. EDITORIALS ON 18 NOVEMBER IN THE MAIN U.S.
NEWSPAPERS  CRISTIANI IS NOT MORE THAN . AT EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES IN MOST COUNTRIES IN WESTERN
EUROPE -- IN ITALY, SPAIN, THE FRG, FRANCE, SWEDEN, DENMARK AND
EVERYWHERE -- THERE HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS CALLED BY LABOR UNIONS,
POLITICAL PARTIES, AND PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES TO
EXPRESS REPUDIATION.  IN LONDON, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HUMAN
RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, URGED EVERYONE TO STAGE
DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF ALL SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES.
