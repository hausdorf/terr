 FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: THE
MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO SOUGHT BOTH TO DISRUPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
ELECTORAL PROCESS, AS WELL AS TO DESTROY THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION
THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND M- 19  HAD CAREFULLY BUILT,
SURPASSING NUMEROUS OBSTACLES.  IT ALSO SEEKS TO WEAKEN THE STATE AND
MAKE COLOMBIANS LOSE FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  HOWEVER, THOSE
WHO FOMENT VIOLENCE WILL NOT MANAGE TO WEAKEN A STRONG DEMOCRACY THAT
IS SUPPORTED BY ALL COLOMBIANS OR TO DESTROY THE PATH OF PEACE THAT WE
HAVE BUILT AFTER SO MANY DIFFICULTIES.

   TWO OF THESE DIFFICULTIES STEM BACK MORE THAN FIVE DECADES.  THE
FIRST DIFFICULTY WAS TO BUILD AN ATMOSPHERE OF PEACE IN A COUNTRY
WHERE THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE INHERITED FLARED UP IN THE FIFTIES, AND
AFTER HAVING EVOLVED, IT HAS TAKEN ON DIFFERENT FORMS, SUCH AS
NARCO-TERRORISM AND BANDS OF HIRED ASSASSINS ENCOURAGED BY GROUPS OF
THE EXTREME RIGHT.

   THE SECOND OBSTACLE, ALONG WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE, IS THE LACK OF
TOLERANCE FOR POLITICAL PLURALISM.  EVEN PROGRESSIVE IDEAS ARE MANY
TIMES CONSIDERED DANGEROUS BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT REALIZE THAT THE COLD
WAR IS OVER.  A PLURALIST DEMOCRACY IS NOT AFRAID OF COMMUNISM.  ON
THE CONTRARY, IT ACCEPTS COMMUNISM, BUT IT DOES NOT ACCEPT VIOLENCE,
REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE.  THE USE OF WEAPONS BOTH TO DEFEND AN
IDEOLOGY, AS WELL AS TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, IS UNACCEPTABLE IN A
PLURALIST DEMOCRACY.

   THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGIC MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO
WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN BEEN ACHIEVED, THAT IS, A
CLEAR, VIABLE, AND DEFINED PATH TO PEACE.  THE OBLIGATION WE HAVE
AHEAD OF US AND THAT WE WILL CARRY OUT UNITED IS TO KEEP THAT PATH OF
PEACE OPEN.

   ALL COLOMBIANS ADMIRE THE PEACE INITIATIVES OF THE M-19, AND WE
SHARE THE GRIEF OF THE RELATIVES AND FOLLOWERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO,
BECAUSE THEIR SADNESS AND ANGER IS SHARED BY ALL COLOMBIANS WHO LOVE
PEACE.  FACTS SHOW THAT THE M-19 MEMBERS WISELY ADOPTED THE DECISION
TO REJOIN DEMOCRACY AND REMAIN IN DEMOCRACY, TO STRUGGLE FOR PEACE,
AND TO PROMOTE LEGALLY THE REFORMS THEY CONSIDER NECESSARY.

   WHEN THEY ABANDONED THEIR WEAPONS, THEY DID NOT ABANDON THE
STRUGGLE FOR THEIR IDEALS.  THEY HAVE ALL THEIR RIGHTS, BECAUSE THEY
ARE NO LONGER A GUERRILLA GROUP.  M-19 IS NOW A POLITICAL PARTY, WITH
ALL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF A POLITICAL PARTY AND WHOSE IDEAS SHOULD BE
TOLERATED.  THOSE WHO, THROUGH VIOLENCE, ARE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE
M-19 FLAG AND TO PREVENT ITS CANDIDATES FROM RUNNING IN THE ELECTIONS
AND TO STOP THEM FROM CONDUCTING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING, ARE NOT JUST
THE ENEMIES OF THAT MOVEMENT, THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE.  THEY ARE
TRYING TO DESTROY THE PATH THAT WAS BUILT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF
THE GUERRILLA GROUPS INTO CIVILIAN LIFE.

   THE MATERIAL AND INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER
ARE THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO SABOTAGE THE
ELECTIONS AND PREVENT NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ALLOW THE VOICE OF M-19 TO BE SILENCED.
THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY REQUESTED AIRTIME ON TELEVISION SO
THAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, LEADER OF THAT PARTY, COULD EXPRESS HIS
OPINIONS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.
