OCCURED A SCANT 1 MONTH AFTER THE MURDER OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT
GOVERNOR ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR.

   A POLICEMAN WAS KILLED AND ANOTHER POLICEMAN WOUNDED DURING THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.  COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT BY HIS
OWN BEHEST.  COL QUINTERO WAS DIRECTING OPERATIONS AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF DEATH THREATS.
HERE IS A REPORT BY GLADYS VARGAS FROM MEDELLIN.

     THIS MORNING ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER
COL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO LEFT HIS RESIDENCE TO BEGIN HIS DAILY
TASKS AT ANTIOQUIA POLICE HEADQUARTERS.  AS THE VEHICLE DROVE THROUGH

ANTONIO ROLDAN WAS KILLED, THE VEHICLE THAT COL QUINTERO WAS IN -- A
WHITE NISSAN PATROL VEHICLE WITH LICENSE PLATES ME-7847 -- DREW TO A
STOP IN FRONT OF A RED LIGHT AT THE CARRERA 80 CROSSING.  SEVERAL
INDIVIDUALS IN A GRAY MAZDA 626 VEHICLE, WITH LICENSE PLATES MI-1630,
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO FIRE VOLLEYS OF SUBMACHINEGUN
FIRE AGAINST COL QUINTERO, WHO DIED INSTANTLY.  

   COL QUINTERO DID NOT HAVE A POLICE ESCORT.  JUST 8 DAYS AGO HE
DECIDED TO DISMISS THE ESCORT, BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO
BE KILLED IF THERE WERE AN ATTACK ON HIM.  ONLY COL QUINTERO AND A
POLICE DRIVER WERE IN THE VEHICLE.

   THE JUDGE OF THE 76TH DISTRICT COURT, WHO DIRECTED THE REMOVAL OF
THE BODY, SAID THAT SEVERAL TYPES OF WEAPONS WERE USED IN THE ATTACK
