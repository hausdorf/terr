 A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS
ANNOUNCED THAT WITHIN THE NEXT 72 HOURS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL
DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF SIX
JESUITS, IF THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT "HINDERED."

   IN A BRIEF STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, MAURICIO SANDOVAL SAID THAT SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI WILL, WITHIN THE PERIOD STATED, ANNOUNCE "THE
NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS" WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MULTIPLE CRIME PERPETRATED
ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR.

   CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED ON SUNDAY THAT "MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES"
PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME, AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THOSE
INDIVIDUALS TO JUSTICE IN EL SALVADOR, "REGARDLESS OF WHOM THEY MAY BE."

   SANDOVAL POINTED OUT THAT "MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE
MURDER, AND TWO PERPETRATED IT."  HE ADDED THAT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ACTED,
ONE THAT MURDERED THE CLERGYMEN AND ANOTHER THAT MURDERED TWO MAIDS,
ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY RESULTS ISSUED BY THE CRIME COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF
SOLVING THE CASE.

   "THERE WAS NO TORTURE OR MISTREATMENT, BUT WORDS WERE EXCHANGED" BETWEEN
THE MURDERERS AND VICTIMS, THE SPOKESMAN SAID, ADDING THAT FIVE OF THE
MURDERED JESUITS HAD RECEIVED "FINISHING SHOTS," ACCORDING TO AUTOPSIES
CARRIED OUT BY SALVADORAN FORENSIC DOCTORS.

   ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY THE COMMISSION GATHERED FROM 115 MEMBERS OF THE
ARMY AND 103 CIVILIANS, THE MURDER TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 0200 AND 0300, AND
THERE WERE "EXPLOSIONS, MACHINE-GUN BLASTS, AND SHOTS," SANDOVAL SAID.

   THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT 2 OFFICERS AND 45 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN "CONFINED IN
VARIOUS HEADQUARTERS PENDING INVESTIGATION."

   AT LEAST 230 CARTRIDGES OF VARIOUS CALIBER, INCLUDING SOME FOR SOVIET MADE
AK-47'S, M-79 ANTITANK WEAPONS, AND M-67 GRENADES, WERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF
THE MURDER, THE OFFICIAL SAID.
