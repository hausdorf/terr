ADMIRED, AND RESPECTED BERNARDO JARAMILLO.

   ESCOBAR GAVIRIA DISCLOSED THAT HE MET SEVERAL TIMES TO INTERCEDE
WITH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA TO ENSURE THAT JARAMILLO OSSA'S LIFE
WOULD BE RESPECTED.  ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ADDED: THIS CAN BE CONFIRMED BY
MANY MEMBERS OF JARAMILLO OSSA'S POLITICAL MOVEMENT AND EVEN BY SOME
OF HIS DAS  BODYGUARDS WHO WERE
WITNESSES AT THOSE MEETINGS.  

   IN HIS LETTER TO MONTANA CUELLAR, ESCOBAR GAVIRIA SAID HE WAS
AMAZED BY HOW EASILY AND QUICKLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOUND SOMEONE TO
BLAME.

PROOF LINKING ESCOBAR GAVIRIA TO THE ASSASSINATION. THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS  HAS ALSO RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS IN WHICH AN ALLEGED
SPOKESMEN OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

COLOMBIA SURRENDERING TO THE UNITED STATES?
