 THE 19 APRIL
MOVEMENT  TODAY ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF
ASSASSINATING M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO.

   "WE ATTRIBUTE PIZARRO'S DEATH TO THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY SERVICES,"
SAID M-19 DIRECTORATE MEMBER RAFAEL VERGARA DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE
HELD IN MEXICO CITY.

   THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF THE FORMER REBEL GROUP
TURNED POLITICAL PARTY HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL
GROUP TO PERMANENTLY PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' LIVES.

   MIGUEL MARIN, ALSO A MEMBER OF THE M-19'S DIRECTORATE, POINTED OUT
THE NEED FOR VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO DESIGNATE
POLITICAL PERSONALITIES WHO WOULD ACCOMPANY EACH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES ON THEIR CAMPAIGNS.

   "WE INTEND TO CHECK THE TRIGGERS OF THE COLOMBIAN OLIGARCHY, WHO
ARE TO BLAME FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN
THE PAST FEW YEARS," THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT'S REPRESENTATIVES SAID.

   THEY DENIED THAT THE M-19 IS IN FAVOR OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, BUT
ADVOCATED THE LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS AND THE NONEXTRADITION OF DRUG
PRODUCERS.

   THE M-19 MEMBERS SAID THAT THE CLARIFICATION OF THEIR TOP LEADER'S
DEATH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CREDIBILITY OF VIRGILIO BARCO'S REGIME.
THEY SAID THAT PIZARRO'S BASIC PROPOSALS TO PACIFY THE COUNTRY WILL BE
TAKEN UP BY ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, WHO REPLACED PIZARRO AS THE M-19'S
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

   THEY ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP PUT AN END TO THE
ARMS TRAFFIC TO COLOMBIA, BECAUSE IN 1989 FOREIGN INVESTMENT INCREASED
BY 148 PERCENT OVER THAT OF 1988.

   "WHAT COLOMBIA NEEDS IS TO ATTAIN PEACE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE.  FOR
THIS REASON, IT IS NECESSARY TO TALK AND NEGOTIATE WITH ALL OF THE
INFLUENTIAL SECTORS IN COLOMBIA, INCLUDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,"
VERGARA AND MARIN POINTED OUT.
