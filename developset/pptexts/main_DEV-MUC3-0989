 GOOD EVENING. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A MAJOR
PORTION OF THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS HELD TODAY.  AFTER 93 PERCENT
OF THE VOTING STATIONS HAVE BEEN COUNTED, AND WHEN ALL THAT IS NEEDED
IS THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE ELECTORAL COURT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAY
THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN AZOCAR HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
FOR THE L990-L994 TERM.

   WITH REGARD TO THAT RESULT THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO
CONVEY TO THE PEOPLE THE FOLLOWING:

   1. ALL CHILEANS SHOULD BE PROUD FOR ONCE AGAIN PARTICIPATING IN AN
EXEMPLARY ELECTION.

   2. ON BEHALF OF THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY A
DESERVED RECOGNITION TO THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS, WHO HAVE LED
AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN ORDER AND TRANQUILITY, AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY AT THE VOTING STATIONS. THEY ENABLED THIS
ELECTION TO BE HELD IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF PEACE, AND THEREBY ALLOWED
THE FREE EXPRESSION OF CIVIC WILL.  WE MUST, HOWEVER, REPUDIATE THE
VIOLENT MURDER OF A MEMBER OF CARABINEROS.

   3. THE PEOPLE MUST REST ASSURED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
PINOCHET, FAITHFUL TO THE COMMITMENT MADE WITH THE ARMED FORCES AND
POLICE, WILL HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE RECENT ELECTIONS RESPECTED.  THE
GOVERNMENT CALLS ON THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER, AND
TO WAIT WITH TRANQUILITY THE FINAL RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION.

   4. DURING THE LAST 16 YEARS CHILE HAS MOVED AHEAD SYSTEMATICALLY
AND WITHOUT HESITATION TOWARD THE GREAT OBJECTIVES SET FORTH AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT IS FULLY
SATISFIED WITH THE WORK OF DEMOCRATIC, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL
RECONSTRUCTION THAT WAS CARRIED OUT BY ALL CHILEANS UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT PINOCHET.  WE HAVE SET FORTH A SOLID BASIS FOR
FUTURE PROSPERITY.

   5. THIS ELECTION FULFILLED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS
FOR REACHING THE FULL DEMOCRACY THAT WAS DESTROYED IN THE PAST BY THE
ENEMIES OF FREEDOM AND PLURALISM.  AS HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT
PINOCHET SAID, 11 SEPTEMBER L973 NOT ONLY REPRESENTED THE OVERTHROW OF
AN ILLEGIMATE AND FAILED GOVERNMENT, BUT IT ALSO REPRESENTED THE END
OF A WORN OUT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REGIME, AND THE NEED TO
BUILD A NEW ONE.  IT WAS NOT JUST A TASK OF SIMPLE RESTORATION, BUT
PRIMARILY A CREATIVE TASK WHICH, IN ORDER TO SUCCEED, HAD TO BE
CARRIED OUT IN THE DEEP ROOTS OF NATIONAL TRADITION.

   6. THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS FULFILLED THE COMMITMENT MADE
IN SEPTEMBER L973.  THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED.  AUTHENTIC
DEMOCRACY AS A WAY OF LIFE AND A FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CREATED,
AND THE TRANSITION PROCESS ENDS ON 11 MARCH L990.  FROM NOW ON IT WILL
BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY CHILEAN TO KEEP WATCH SO THAT THE
STABILITY AND PROGRESS ACHIEVED WITH POLITICAL WILL AND CONSTANT
EFFORT WILL CONTINUE TO PREVAIL IN OUR FREE SOCIETY. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. GOOD NIGHT.
