 LAST NIGHT, A FEW HOURS
BEFORE THE CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, A VIOLENT EXPLOSION DAMAGED
THE WINDOWS AND FACING OF THE SALVADORAN CONSULATE IN SANTIAGO.  NO
ONE WAS INJURED.

   A FLAG FROM THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR) WAS FOUND
AT THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE FPMR IS A CLANDESTINE LEFTIST
GROUP THAT PROMOTES "ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE" AGAINST THE MILITARY
GOVERNMENT HEADED BY GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET.

   POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED SERIOUS
DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY BUILDING AND TO NEARBY STRUCTURES IN
THE ELEGANT PROVIDENCIA NEIGHORHOOD IN EASTERN SANTIAGO.

   THE GOVERNMENT CHARGES THAT THE FPMR, WHICH ON 14 DECEMBER WILL
MARK 6 YEARS OF SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY, IS THE "ARMED BRANCH" OF THE
OUTLAWED COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE.  AS OF MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THE
CARABINEROS AND POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS WERE CARRYING OUT
AN INTENSIVE OPERATION TO ARREST THOSE RESPONISBLE FOR THE ATTACK.
