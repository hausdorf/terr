 GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA, CHIEF OF THE
COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE, WARNED THE COUNTRY TODAY THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS
"WILL CONTINUE TO SHOOT," AND ANNOUNCED AN ALL-OUT DECLARATION OF WAR
AGAINST THEM.

   MAZA, WHO 1 MONTH AGO ESCAPED MIRACULOUSLY FROM A CAR BOMB ATTACK STAGED
BY THE DRUG MAFIA, WARNED ABOUT THE "WAR" THAT THE "DRUG LORDS" HAVE
UNLEASHED AGAINST THE COUNTRY, NOTING THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FIRE THEIR
WEAPONS.

   THE POLICE CHIEF DECLARED THAT THE STATE ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING
CRIMINALITY WILL STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE WHO SEEK BY THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIONS
TO IMPOSE THEIR OWN LAWS.

   ALSO, MAZA DIRECTLY ACCUSED THE DRUG CARTELS OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
CHAIN OF ASSASSINATIONS THAT HAVE SHAKEN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.

   "WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT THEM," HE WARNED.

   THE SEVERE MEASURES ADOPTED LAST NIGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, AFTER THE KILLINGS DURING THE PAST 72
HOURS OF A JUDGE, A POLICE COMMANDER, AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS
GALAN, WILL PERMIT THE SECURITY CORPS TO FORCEFULLY CONFRONT THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE THAT HAS GRIPPED COLOMBIA, HE DECLARED.
