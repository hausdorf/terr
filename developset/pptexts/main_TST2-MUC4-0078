 ATTENTION: A
REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR STATES THAT FIGHTING CONTINUES IN THE
NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE CITY.  OUR FORCES ARE FINDING LITTLE RESISTANCE
FROM THE SO-CALLED TROOPS BROUGHT FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY.
THE REPORT STATES THAT DURING TODAY'S CLASHES IN CIUDAD DELGADO, LOS
ALPES, GUADALUPE, AND SAN PATRICIO NEIGHBORHOODS, THE TREASURY POLICE
SUFFERED THREE CASUALTIES.  WE INFLICTED TWO CASUALTIES ON THE
TREASURY POLICE IN LOS ALPES NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE 6TH MILITARY
DETACHMENT SUFFERED ONE CASUALTY DURING A CLASH IN SAN PATRICIO
NEIGHBORHOOD.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT FMLN  FORCES HAVE SET UP BARRICADES ON THE
NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD AND POWER LINES HAVE BEEN SABOTAGED.  AS A RESULT
OF THIS SABOTAGE, AN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR DOES NOT HAVE POWER.  WE
HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT TWO TRANSFORMERS WERE DESTROYED ON KM 10 OF THE
NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD, WHERE BARRICADES WERE ALSO SET UP.  THE REPORT
ADDS THAT THE ENEMY SHOWED UP 90 MINUTES AFTER THE BARRICADES HAD BEEN
SET UP AND HEAVY FIGHTING RESULTED.  THE ENEMY TROOPS SUFFERED FOUR
CASUALTIES; OUR FORCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED
PROBLEMS ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.  AT THIS HOUR, 1613 ,
THE REBEL PRESENCE IN INCREASING ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.

   ATTENTION: DURING YESTERDAY'S ATTACK, WITH PEOPLE'S ARTILLERY ON
4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, WE INFLICTED EIGHT CASUALTIES.  THESE
EIGHT CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.

   AT NOON TODAY, CLASHES WITH 1ST MILITARY DETACHMENT TROOPS WAS
REPORTED IN LA CRUZ HILL, SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES JURISDICTION.  WE
REPEAT: TODAY AT NOON, FIGHTING WAS REPORTED IN LA CRUZ HILL, SAN
MIGUEL DE MERCEDES, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.

   THIS HAS BEEN THE LATEST REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED.  THERE IS
FIGHTING IN CIUDAD DELGADO, LOS ALPES, GUADALUPE, SAN PATRICIO, AND
OUR GUERRILLA COLUMNS ARE SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN PART OF
THE CITY.  IT IS NOW 1615  AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT
REACTED.  THIS GIVES US AN IDEA OF HOW LOW MORALE IS AMONG THE
SOLDIERS IN SAN SALVADOR.  THIS NEW BLOW AGAINST THE ENEMY FORCES IN
SAN SALVADOR HAS CAUSED THE MORALE OF THE ENEMY FORCES TO DROP EVEN
FURTHER.

   ATTENTION: WE HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A REBEL AMBUSH
IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR.  THE REPORT ADDS THAT AT 0630
 TODAY, REBEL FORCES AMBUSHED A VEHICLE TRANSPORTING
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN. THE AMBUSH OCCURRED ON KM 9.5 ON THE NORTHERN
TRUNK ROAD.  THE GUARDSMEN WERE HEADING INTO AN AREA WHERE THE FMLN
REBELS HAVE SET UP BARRICADES.  A POWERFUL GUAZAPA-TYPE MINE AND
RIFLES WERE USED IN THE AMBUSH.  AT LEAST 10 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING A
NATIONAL GUARD OFFICER, WERE INFLICTED.  WE REPEAT: A NATIONAL GUARD
OFFICER IS INCLUDED AMONG THE CASUALTIES WE INFLICTED DURING THIS
AMBUSH CARRIED OUT ON KM 9.5 ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD.

   LIKEWISE, WE HAVE LEARNED THAT FIGHTING CONTINUES IN MEJICANOS,
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CIUDAD DELGADO, AND SOYAPANGO.  HEAVY FIGHTING IS ALSO
BEING REPORTED IN APOPA AND MARIONA.  REBEL FORCES ARE SPREADING OUT

COMRADES; OUR PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING YOU IN SAN SALVADOR.
