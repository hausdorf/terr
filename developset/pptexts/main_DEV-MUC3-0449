 PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA
SAID IN BOGOTA TODAY THAT IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT IN PANAMA THERE
ARE "PUPPET GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE CRUDELY DESIGNATED AND THEN
REMOVED."

   GARCIA, WHO MADE A 6-HOUR TECHNICAL STOPOVER IN BOGOTA ON HIS
FLIGHT FROM BELGRADE, WHERE HE ATTENDED THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT
SUMMIT, VISITED COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, WITH WHOM HE HAD
LUNCH AND TO WHOM HE EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY IN THE ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE
BEING WAGED IN COLOMBIA.

   ASKED BY REPORTERS, GARCIA SAID HIS AMBASSADOR TO PANAMA HAS BEEN
RECALLED. "THIS DOES NOT MEAN, HOWEVER, THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN BROKEN."  HE ADVOCATED LATIN AMERICAN "GOVERNMENTS
THAT REPRESENT THEIR PEOPLES' WILLS THROUGH ELECTIONS."

   "WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THERE ARE PUPPET GOVERNMENTS IN PANAMA AND
THAT THEY ARE CRUDELY DESIGNATED AND REMOVED.  WE LATIN AMERICANS
CANNOT ACCEPT THIS PROCEDURE," HE ADDED.

   HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THE
NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AND POINTED OUT THAT THE ANTIDRUG PLAN
LAUNCHED BY U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, "ALTHOUGH LATE, SHOULD SUPPORT
THE AFFECTED COUNTRIES MORE STRONGLY."

   GARCIA ALSO URGED A PRESIDENTAL SUMMIT, INCLUDING EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES, "FOR TRUE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING."

   WHILE IN BOGOTA, AND SHORTLY BEFORE BOARDING HIS FLIGHT FOR PERU,
GARCIA VISITED EL ESPECTADOR'S OFFICES, WHICH WERE DAMAGED BY A BOMB
ON 2 SEPTEMBER, AND EXPRESSED HIS SYMPATHY TO THE PAPER'S DIRECTORS.
