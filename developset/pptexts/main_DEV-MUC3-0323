 IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE IN COLOMBIA'S
RECENT HISTORY, THE PATRIOTIC UNION  TOOK OVER THIS EVENING THE MAIN
OFFICES OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY IN BOGOTA AND TOLD THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY
WILL NOT LEAVE UNTIL A GOVERNMENT MEETING IS CONVENED TO ANALYZE THE UPSURGE
IN VIOLENCE AGAINST UP MEMBERS.

   THE UP, THE COUNTRY'S THIRD-RANKING POLITICAL FORCE, LOST ABOUT 950 OF
ITS MEMBERS AND LEADERS OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS.  THIS MORNING, UP LEGAL
ADVISOR ABELARDO DAZA WAS SHOT.  

   THE TAKEOVER IS BY UP PRESIDENT BERNARDO JARAMILLO, VICE PRESIDENT DIEGO
MONTANA, SECRETARY CARLOS ROMERO, AND TREASURER OSCAR DUENAS, WHO ASK THAT
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT DISCLOSE THE RESULTS OF THE FIGHT TO
COMBAT THE RIGHT-WING SQUADS AND THE "TRUE BEHAVIOR" OF SOME MILITARY AND
POLICE LEADERS IN SOME AREAS OF THE COUNTRY.

   JARAMILLO, WHO RECENTLY DENOUNCED BEFORE EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN ENTITIES
COLOMBIA'S "DIRTY WAR," SAID THAT "THE UP AND PUBLIC OPINION NEED TO KNOW
WHY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA  AND OTHER WELL
KNOWN CRIMINALS HAVE NOT BEEN CAUGHT."

   JARAMILLO ADDED: "WE DO NOT WANT MORE BODYGUARDS, BUT THE POLITICAL
RESOLVE TO DISMANTLE THE GANG OF HIRED GUNMEN AND ARREST THEIR LEADERS."
