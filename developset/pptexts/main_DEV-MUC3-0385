 THE FULL SCOPE OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND
DEATH THAT HAS SWAMPED COLOMBIA OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IS NOW
BEGINNING TO BE ASSESSED.  LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD
HAVE REMAINED ON THE SIDELINES OF THAT SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY'S
DOMESTIC STRIFE, WHERE HUMAN LIFE IS ALMOST WORTHLESS.  VENEZUELAN
PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN HE TOLD
COLOMBIAN RADIO CARACOL THAT WE MAY NOT BE DOING WHAT WE MUST
CONCERNING CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA.  CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IS
CONCERNED THAT SOME NATIONS MAY BE GETTING USED TO LIVNG IN A CLIMATE
OF COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION.

   DAILY EVENTS OCCUR IN COLOMBIA AMID A CLIMATE OF NATIONAL UNCERTAINTY.
BANDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BUILT AN EMPIRE OF DIRTY MONEY AND
BLOODTHIRSTY MAFIAS IN DEATHLY COMPLICITY WITH THE MILITARY DEPLOYMENT OF
140 PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  YEARS AGO, WHEN THESE GROUPS ANNOUNCED THEIR GUNS
WERE AIMED AT PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST PERSONALITIES, THEY OPERATED WITH THE
UNSPOKEN COMPLICITY OF MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, FOR
SOME TIME NOW, THE MURDER VICTIMS HAVE BEEN LEFTISTS, LIBERALS,
CONSERVATIVES, AND EVEN POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT PERSONS WHO OPPOSE THE CHAOS
CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS, LANDOWNERS, SOME OFFICERS, AND PARAMILITARY
GROUPS.  LUIS CARLOS GALAN, 46, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, LIBERAL SENATOR,
LAWYER, AND NEWSMEN IS THE LATEST VICTIM OF THIS DEATHLY SPIRIAL.  HIS
REMAINS  LUIS CARLOS GALAN.  DRUG
TRAFFICKERS HAVE SHOWN THEIR HIT LIST IS NEVERENDING.  THEY ALSO BRING TO
THE FORE THE POWER AND SCOPE OF THE DIRTY WAR THESE PEOPLE BEGAN IN THE
COUNTRY AMID THE GOVERNMENT'S INACTION.

   MANY WONDER HOW THE PARAMILITARY TOP COMMAND CAN GO UNPUNISHED,
CONSIDERING THAT ITS CHIEF LEADERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, BECAUSE MORE OFTEN
THAN NOT THE KILLERS DO VERY LITTLE TO COVER THEIR TRACKS.  LOOKING AHEAD,
THE COLOMBIAN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT WILL CONCLUDE IN NEXT YEAR'S ELECTIONS
HAS BEEN DEALT A HEAVY BLOW WITH GALAN'S MURDER.  THE REMAINING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO CONDUCT THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SURROUNDED BY
ARMIES OF BODYGUARDS, AN ARRANGEMENT WIDELY USED IN COLOMBIA BY POLITICIANS,
LABOR LEADERS, JUDGES, ARTISTS, AND MINOR OFFICIALS.  PERPLEXITY OVER WHAT
HAPPENED IN COLOMBIA IS ONE OF THE INITIAL REACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA.  LUIS
CARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ALSO CALLS FOR CONDEMNATION.  PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE IT
MAY HELP MAKE THE CONTINENT MEDITATE ON WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ADVISABLE TO BE
INDIFFERENT TO THE COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION THAT PREVAILS IN COLOMBIA.
