SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AFTER 5 DAYS OF COMBAT, CONFRONTING THIS ARMED
AGGRESSION BY THE FMLN 
TERRORISTS,  I WANT TO INFORM YOU OF THE SITUATION
THROUGHOUT THE NATION:

   IN THE WESTERN AREA, THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS.  IN THE EASTERN AREA,
THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS.  IN SAN MIGUEL CITY, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE
COMMAND HAS BEEN OPERATING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER, AND IT HAS
AVOIDED HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION; THEREFORE, THERE ARE
TERRORISTS IN THE  NEIGHBORHOODS.  ALSO IN USULUTAN
LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING,  BUT AT PRESENT
ONLY SOME EXPLOSIONS AND SOME SPORADIC FIRING ARE HEARD IN THE
VICINITY OF THE CITY OF USULUTAN.  IN ZACATECOLUCA YESTERDAY WE
MANAGED TO CONTROL THE POPULATION COMPLETELY.  WE DISLODGED THE
TERRORISTS FROM THE 27 SEPTEMBER NEIGHBORHOOD.

   WE HAVE HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THE FMLN HAS
WAGED ITS GREATEST EFFORTS HERE. THEY ARE 
TERRORISTS, AND THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH.  IN SOME
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHERN AREA, THE  MEJICANOS,
 AS OF SUNDAY, 12 NOVEMBER. IN SOME  AS IT WAS YESTERDAY.  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE  OF THE CAPITAL CITY.  IN MEJICANOS, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
 NORTH OF THE GUADALUPE AND SOYAPANGO NEIGHBORHOODS,
 REPARTO SANTA MARTA, AND ALTOS DEL . IN THIS AREA, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE CARRIED OUT ACTIONS
TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO NEUTRALIZE THIS GENOCIDE .

   ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE SOME PARTIAL
RESULTS. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SUSTAINED THE FOLLOWING: 177 DEAD AND
251 WOUNDED.

   AMONG THE TERRORISTS THERE ARE 655 DEAD AND 491 WOUNDED.  WE HAVE
CAPTURED 92 FMLN MEMBERS, AND 6 FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE TURNED THEMSELVES
IN.  AS FOR THE CIVILIANS, WE REGRET 47 PERSONS HAVE DIED, AND 153
HAVE BEEN WOUNDED.

   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE SEIZED FROM THE FMLN TERRORISTS 324 RIFLES,
75 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 26 MORTARS, 8 MACHINEGUNS, 15
SUBMACHINEGUNS, AND 40 WEAPONS OF OTHER TYPES.  FOUR ARSENALS HAVE
ALSO  IN MEJICANOS, WHERE THE TERRORISTS HAD A
CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: YOU MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ARMED FORCES
AND IN YOUR GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING JOINTLY. OUR COMMANDER
IN CHIEF IS UP TO DATE ON THE SITUATION, AND , AND
WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THE ARMED FORCES IS WORKING IN A VERY
PROFESSIONAL MANNER. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE THIS
SITUATION BY ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT
TAKES LONGER FOR THE ARMED FORCES TO DO THINGS.

   ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE WANT TO THANK YOU, OUR PEOPLE,
FOR YOUR SUPPORT, AS YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDING US WITH PLENTY OF
INFORMATION, SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS IN THE VARIOUS COMBAT AREAS, AND--
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL--CONDEMNING AND REJECTING THIS TERRORIST
ATTACK. THAT IS THE  OF THE FMLN.

   WE ARE ALL WORKING, STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, TO
MAINTAIN FREEDOM , AND ACHIEVE PEACE. I ALSO WANT TO
INFORM YOU THAT AFTER VISITING THIS AFTERNOON THE VARIOUS AREAS WHERE
WE ARE , THE MORALE OF OUR TROOPS AND OFFICERS IS
VERY HIGH. AND THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING
TO DEFEND YOU.

    THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE A VERY LOW MORALE,
 MANY, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW AWARE OF THEIR
CASUALTIES AND .

   I WANT TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ON BEHALF OF THE
ARMED FORCES, TO STRONGLY CONDEMN THOSE WHO THIS MORNING MASSACRED SIX
JESUIT PRIESTS. WE REGRET AS WELL THE DEATHS OF OTHER CIVILIANS,
INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CONFLICT. WE ALSO
REGRET THE DEATHS AMONG OUR ARMED FORCES.

   IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE,
AND THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL COMMAND ARE PROUD OF THE PROFESSIONAL
WORK BEING DONE AT THE VARIOUS GARRISONS OF OUR ARMED FORCES.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, ON BEHALF OF THE ARMED FORCES, WE ASK FOR YOUR
SUPPORT. YOU MUST CONTINUE GOING TO WORK AND CONTINUE WORKING.  IN
CONCLUSION, I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN FOR THEIR MORAL AND
MATERIAL SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES AT SUCH A
DIFFICULT TIME.
