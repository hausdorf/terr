 NO CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT WAS
REACHED AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE CURRENT ROUND OF
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN DELEGATES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

   THE DELEGATIONS MET IN THE PASTORAL HOUSE OF THE CONGREGATION OF
THE NUNS OF ST CLARE IN MORAVIA, 4 KM FROM SAN JOSE.

   DURING THE DIALOGUE, THE DELEGATES BECAME INVOLVED IN A DISCUSSION
ON IMPLEMENTATION OF A POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE AND THE FMLN INSISTED THAT
THERE MUST FIRST BE APPROVAL OF A PLAN TO AMEND THE SALVADORAN
CONSTITUTION, THAT THE ARMY BE PURGED, THAT THE REPRESSION END, THAT
MODIFICATIONS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BE STARTED, AND THAT MEASURES BE
ADOPTED TO GUARANTEE THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION.

   FOR THEIR PART, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES INSISTED THAT
THE FMLN MUST DECLARE AN IMMEDIATE HALT TO HOSTILITIES EFFECTIVE 18
OCTOBER.

   THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INDICATED THAT "IT COMMITS ITSELF TO HALT
ALL OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AND TO OFFER GUARANTEES TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS
OF ALL GUERRILLAS SO THAT THEY CAN JOIN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL,
SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC LIFE."

   FMLN COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS SAID: "WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE
GOVERNMENT'S CONDITIONS FOR THE CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN A
SURRENDER ON OUR PART."

   FMLN SPOKESMAN MIGUEL SAENZ SAID: "THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONCRETE REPLIES TO OUR REQUESTS."

   SAENZ SAID: "SINCE THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT DELEGATES, THERE ARE NO AGREEMENTS FOR PEACE IN OUR
COUNTRY."

   JUSTICE MINISTER OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA SAID: "FIRST WE NEED THE
FMLN TO CEASE HOSTILITIES, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE
GUERRILLAS CAN RETURN TO THE MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY.

   SANTAMARIA REITERATED: "WE WANT PEACE, AN END TO THE WAR, AND AN
END TO THE KILLING, THE PAIN, AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE."

   UN ENVOY ALVARO SOTO AND OAS ENVOY RICARDO GJIVOJE ARE ATTENDING
THE DIALOGUE AS OBSERVERS, AS WELL AS MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ,
AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR.

   DURING THE SECOND DAY OF TALKS, THERE WAS FRICTION BETWEEN THE FMLN
AND THE GOVERNMENT WHEN INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL OPENLY
ACCUSED THE FMLN OF MURDERING ANA ISABEL CASANOVA ,
DAUGHTER OF COLONEL OSCAR EDGARDO CASANOVA, DIRECTOR OF THE ARMED
FORCES STUDIES CENTER.

   FMLN COMMANDER "LUISA" MERCEDES DEL CARMEN RETANA IMMEDIATELY
DENIED SANDOVAL'S CHARGE AND SAID: "THE FMLN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
THAT MURDER PERPETRATED TODAY IN SAN SALVADOR."

   THE MURDER ALSO PROMPTED ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEETING BY THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO SAID: "THE FMLN IS IN THE
HABIT OF PERPETRATING THIS SORT OF ACTIONS WHEN IMPORTANT MEETINGS ARE
BEING HELD."

   THE FMLN DELEGATES SAID: "THE CHARGE AGAINST THE FMLN IS
GROUNDLESS."

   THIS AFTERNOON, MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ SEEMED VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE SAN JOSE TALKS, "BECAUSE FOR THE DIALOGUE TO
SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY AND URGENT THAT THE TWO SIDES, THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FMLN, YIELD A LITTLE."

   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DIALOGUE MAY CONTINUE TOMORROW WHEN THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN ANNOUNCED THEY WILL ISSUE SEPARATE
PRESS RELEASES.
