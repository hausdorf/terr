 THE MRTA 
TODAY DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER OF FORMER
DEFENSE MINISTER ENRIQUE LOPEZ ALBUJAR.

   GENERAL OSVALDO DIAZ SALVADOR, CHIEF OF THE 7TH SUBREGION OF THE NATIONAL
POLICE, HAS CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF THE LEAFLETS, AND ADDED THAT THE
MURDER CASE IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.  HE SAID THAT AMONG THE THOUSANDS
OF DETAINEES THERE ARE 16 SUSPECTS WHO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
THE MURDER OF THE OUTSTANDING GENERAL.

     WELL, THERE ARE TWO OPERATIONS.  FIRST,
THE DRAGNET OPERATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS ESTABLISHED
BY WITNESSES ARE ARRESTED, AND SECOND, THERE IS A MORE SPECIFIC OPERATION
BEING CONDUCTED BY THE SPECIALIZED UNITS.

    IS THERE ANY INFORMATION YET REGARDING THE CAPTURE OF THE
MURDERERS OF THE FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER?

    THESE OPERATIONS SEEK TO CLEAR UP BOTH A CRIME THAT HAS
SHOCKED THE NATION AND ALSO THE KILLING OF TWO PATROLMEN WHO WERE MURDERED
IN COLD BLOOD THE DAY BEFORE THE GENERAL WAS MURDERED.

    DO THE POLICE HAVE IDENTIKITS OF THE MURDERERS?

    WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME IDENTIKITS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE
PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK FROM THE SPECIALIZED UNITS OF THE TECHNICAL
POLICE.  BASED ON THESE IDENTIKITS THE POLICE WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC AND
SELECTIVE.

    HOW MANY IDENTIKITS DO YOU HAVE SO FAR?

    SO FAR WE HAVE RECEIVED THREE IDENTIKITS.

    THE MURDER IS ATTRIBUTED TO MRTA AND NOT TO THE SHINING PATH.
WHAT NEWS DO THE HAVE ON THIS?

    I BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL HAVE THE FINAL
WORD ON THIS.

    IS IT TRUE THAT THE MRTA HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
MURDER?

    WELL, WE ALL KNOW THAT SOME LEAFLETS HAVE APPEARED TODAY
INSIDE A NEWSPAPER THAT CLAIMS TO BE THE MOUTHPIECE ON THIS MATTER, BUT I DO
NOT THINK THIS IS FINAL.
