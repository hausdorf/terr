 THE GOVERNMENT
OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI YESTERDAY REAFFIRMED ITS WILLINGNESS TO
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS .  IT ALSO MADE AN APPEAL SO THAT NO
ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT ARE MADE IN ORDER NOT TO
GENERATE SPECULATIONS THAT POLITICIZE THIS CASE.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, THE GOVERNMENT MADE THE PRECEDING
STATEMENT BECAUSE OF THE "BIASED PROPAGANDISTIC CAMPAIGN BEING
DEVELOPED BY THE FMLN  AND
OTHER POLITICAL AND LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS, SEEKING TO CREATE A
DISTORTED VIEW OF THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE COUNTRY."

   THE COMMUNIQUE RECALLS THAT ON THE SAME DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK
AGAINST FENASTRAS, THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNED SUCH CRIMINAL ACTION.  THE
COMMUNIQUE ALSO EXPRESSES THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WITHIN A FRAMEWORK WORTHY OF CONFIDENCE.  THE
GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO CREATE A COMMISSION THAT WILL BE COMPOSED OF
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, CEDES , POLITICAL PARTIES, LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS --
INCLUDING ONE FROM FENASTRAS -- DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER.

   HOWEVER, FENASTRAS LEADERS HAVE CONTINUED HINDERING THE
INVESTIGATION AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS.

   THE GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE FENASTRAS REFUSAL TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMISSION COULD BE INTERPRETED AS "AN INTENTIONAL
PLAN BY FENASTRAS LEADERS TO PREVENT THE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TERRORIST ATTACK."  THEREFORE, THE
GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE REQUESTS THE ABANDONMENT OF SUCH AN ATTITUDE.

   THE GOVERNMENT, THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS, BELIEVES THAT THE
INVESTIGATION IS LEGAL AND THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE MORAL DUTY TO HELP
IN THE INVESTIGATION TO CLARIFY THIS CASE.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REITERATED ITS APPEAL TO
CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM MAKING ACCUSATIONS LACKING SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT SPECULATION THAT HAMPERS THE NORMAL
DEVELOPMENT OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS THAT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.  THE
GOVERNMENT REITERATED THAT "ITS TRUE OBJECTIVE IS TO CLARIFY THIS
BARBARIC ACTION AND TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE, NO MATTER WHO THEY
ARE."

   "WE REQUEST ALL CITIZENS TO ABSTAIN FROM ISSUING SPECULATIVE
OPINIONS, AND, SHOULD THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT THAT WOULD HELP
CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT, THEY SHOULD DO IT WITHIN THE
JUDICIAL PROCESS," THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE STATES.

   THE GOVERNMENT REAFFIRMED ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE SEARCHING
FOR PEACE THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS AND DIALOGUE.  ACCORDING TO THE
MEXICO AGREEMENTS, THE FLMN IS ALSO OBLIGED TO CONTINUE WITH THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS AND "CANNOT UNILATERALLY WITHDRAW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
VIOLATING NOT ONLY THOSE AGREEMENTS, BUT ALSO THE ASPIRATION OF OUR
PEOPLE, WHICH IS TO ATTAIN PEACE," THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS.
