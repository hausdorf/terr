 THE GOVERNMENT SAID TODAY THAT IT WILL
CONTINUE TO EXTRADITE COLOMBIAN CITIZENS SOUGHT BY THE UNITED STATES.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS BECAUSE THERE IS
CURRENTLY NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THAT COUNTRY.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH ALSO DENIED ANY POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN A
DIALOGUE WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE
GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG-TRAFFICKING GROUPS AND
THEIR CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE POLICY
ALLOWS NO ROOM FOR TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS, OR DIALOGUES.
THEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT REJECTS ANY PROPOSAL TO MEDIATE WITH DRUG
TRAFFICKERS -- EVEN IF THE PROPOSAL IS DIRECTLY ISSUED BY THE
EXTRADITABLES OR THEIR SPOKESMEN.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT
WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE LEGISLATIVE DECREE 18-60 OF 1989, WHICH
ALLOWS FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS.  THIS DECREE
WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE.

   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL JUSTIFIES ITS DECISION BY RECALLING
THE MANY ACTS OF TERRORISM PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- 222 IN 2
MONTHS -- AND THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS.  THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT THE
DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE NOW TRYING TO DISGUISE THEIR CRIMINAL POSITIONS
BY CLAIMING THAT THEY ADVOCATE PEACE.

   THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT OR SUSPENSION OF COLOMBIAN
CITIZENS' EXTRADITION WAS THE MAIN TOPIC DISCUSSED TODAY IN JURIDICAL
AND POLITICAL CIRCLES IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN THE UNITED STATES.
JOURNALISTS AND LAWYERS CAREFULLY READ THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S
RULING ON THE DECREE ALLOWING FOR EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANNELS.  EVERYONE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE EXTRADITABLES SAID, IN A
LETTER ISSUED YESTERDAY, THAT THEY FULLY ABIDED BY THE COURT'S RULING.

   THE COURT RULED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE EXTRADITIONS VIA ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANNELS ARE ALLOWED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN CASES WHERE THERE IS
ALREADY AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY, THE EXTRADITION MUST BE CARRIED OUT
ACCORDING TO THE TREATY.  THE COURT BELIEVES THAT THE RULING IS QUITE
CLEAR.

     THE GOVERNMENT
MUST DECIDE IF THERE IS A TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES OR NOT BEFORE
IT ENFORCES THE EXTRADITION THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS.  

   NEVERTHELESS, THE COURT'S RULING DOES NOT END THE EXTRADITIONS TO
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH THE COURT BELIEVES THAT AN
EXTRADITION TREATY IS STILL IN EFFECT WITH THAT COUNTRY -- THE ONE
SIGNED IN 1888 -- AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED INSTEAD OF
 RESORTING TO EXTRADITIONS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS, THE
GOVERNMENT CLEARLY SAYS THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UNITED
STATES.

     THE 1979 TREATY
HAD BEEN ANNULLED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, BUT ACCORDING TO
THE STATE COUNCIL, THAT TREATY REPLACED -- SO TO SPEAK -- THE 1933
TREATY SIGNED IN MONTEVIDEO AND THE 1888 TREATY.  THEREFORE, THINGS
ARE NOW THE SAME AS YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE.  

   MEANWHILE, THE BODYGUARD OF EL ESPECTADOR'S CHIEF OF DISTRIBUTION
IN MEDELLIN, PEDRO LUIS OSORIO, WAS ASSASSINATED THIS AFTERNOON IN A
DOWNTOWN AREA OF ANTIOQUIA'S CAPITAL.
