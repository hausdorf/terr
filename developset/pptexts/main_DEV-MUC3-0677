 NINE PEOPLE WERE
WOUNDED--SEVEN CIVILIANS AND TWO SOLDIERS--DURING AN OFFENSIVE
LAUNCHED BY THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER
SALVADORAN CITIES, HUMANITARIAN INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPORTED.

   DURING THE OFFENSIVE, GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ATTACKED PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S RESIDENCE AND
MILITARY GARRISONS IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES.

   THE RED CROSS SENT DOZENS OF AMBULANCES TO THE AREAS MOST EFFECTED
TO EVACUATE THE INJURED AND CITIZENS WHO WERE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE
BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE GUERRILLAS.

   EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, SPORADIC BOMB EXPLOSIONS AND MACHINEGUN FIRE
COULD STILL BE HEARD IN SOME PARTS OF SAN SALVADOR. THE ARMY HAS
IMPLEMENTED STRICT CONTROL ON THE DESERTED STREETS.

   RADIO STATIONS WERE ASKED TO JOIN A RADIO NETWORK FROM WHERE THE
GOVERNMENT HAS URGED THE POPULATION TO REMAIN CALM. THE NETWORK IS
CARRYING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC WHICH IS INTERRUPTED BY "NEWS BULLETINS"
READ BY ARMY SPOKESMEN.

   ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO REPORTS, NINE PEOPLE WERE HURT, NEITHER THE
ARMY NOR THE GUERRILLAS HAVE ISSUED AN OFFICIAL REPORT ON THE POSSIBLE
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES.

   ACCORDING TO POLITICAL OBSERVERS, THIS HAS BEEN THE GUERILLAS'
LARGEST MILITARY OFFENSIVE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ONE HAVING
THE MOST SERIOUS EFFECTS IN THE CAPITAL.
