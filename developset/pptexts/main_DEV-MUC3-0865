 ATTORNEY GENERAL
MAURICIO COLORADO, INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS IN EL
SALVADOR, SAID TODAY THAT THE DECLARATIONS MADE SO FAR, AMONG THEM
THOSE MADE BY LUCIA BARRERA CERNA, ONE OF THE MAIN WITNESSES, "ARE NOT
CONCLUSIVE, NOR HAVE THEY SHED ANY LIGHT" ON THE IDENTITY OF THE
KILLERS."

   THE JESUITS, FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN, WERE MURDERED 9
DAYS AGO BY A GROUP OF MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS DURING A "CURFEW"
DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE THAT
BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   LUCIA BARRERA, WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE COLORADO, A GOVERNMENT
COMMISSION INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS, AND SEVERAL DIPLOMATS, AMONG
THEM SPANISH AMBASSADOR FRANCISCO CADIZ, SAID THAT THE MURDERERS
NUMBERED BETWEEN 30 AND 40 UNIDENTIFIED MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS.
COLORADO SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT "THERE ARE SEVERAL WITNESSES,
NONE OF WHICH HAS SHED MUCH LIGHT ON THE CASE.  THEIR DECLARATIONS ARE
NOT CONCLUSIVE REGARDING THIS SAD AND REGRETTABLE EVENT."  HE STRESSED
"THAT IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY DID IT."

   ACCORDING TO COLORADO, NEITHER FBI AGENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES,
NOR SCOTLAND YARD AGENTS FROM GREAT BRITAIN, NOR THE SPANISH
GOVERNMENT'S DELEGATES -- AS REQUESTED BY SALVDORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI WHEN HE PROMISED TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE EXHAUSTIVELY --
HAVE ARRIVED IN EL SALVADOR.

   HE SAID THAT THE COURT WILL SUBPOENA MARIA JULIA HERNANDEZ,
DIRECTOR OF THE SAN SALVADORAN ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, "TO
DECLARE WHAT SHE KNOWS, WHO TOLD HER WHAT, AND TO SAY IF SHE WAS AT
THE SCENE."

   THE ARCHBISHOPRIC'S LEGAL AID OFFICE, A HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION,
HAS PROMISED TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION JOINTLY WITH THE JESUITS.

   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT "WE ARE INVESTIGATING ALL CLUES,"
WHEN ASKED BY REPORTERS IF HE WOULD INTERROGATE THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE
PATROLLING THE UNIVERSITY AREA WHERE THE MURDERS TOOK PLACE ON 16
NOVEMBER.

   MEANWHILE, JOSE MARIA TOJEIRA, JESUIT SUPERIOR IN CENTRAL AMERICA,
SAID THAT THE MAIN WITNESS TO THE MURDERS IS "SAFE AND SOUND" ABROAD,
POSSIBLY IN THE UNITED STATES.

   ACCORDING TO TOJEIRA, THE WITNESS, WHO WAS INTERROGATED REPEATEDLY,
WAS KEPT UNDER STRICT SECURITY. HE STRESSED THAT SHE LEFT FOR AN
UNKNOWN DESTINATION AND THAT SHE "IS AT EASE BECAUSE SHE HAS TOLD THE
TRUTH."

   JESUIT SUPERIOR TOJEIRA AND ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, ARCHBISHOP OF
SAN SALVADOR, HAVE ASSERTED THAT THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF THAT THE
MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS WERE EITHER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OR
PERSONS CLOSELY LINKED TO THEM.

   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS BELIEF, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REPLIED, "I DO
NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE RASH TO SAY THAT THE
ARMY DID IT."
