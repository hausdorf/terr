   THE 22 JANUARY EDITION OF THE BOGOTA DAILY EL TIEMPO PUBLISHED
INFORMATION FROM COLOMBIAN POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AND STATE
SECURITY INTERCEPTS IDENTIFYING DRUG KINGPINS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE AS THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED
"EXTRADITABLES."  THIS PRESS NOTE PROVIDES HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 22
JANUARY ARTICLE.

   DRUG BARONS PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND JORGE LUIS OCHOA VASQUE, WHO
ARE REPUTED TO BE THE BRAINS BEHIND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S PLAN TO
SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL
POLICE AND STATE SECURITY AS THE ONLY ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
COMMUNIQUES SENT BY THE SO-CALLED "EXTRADITABLES," ACCORDING TO THE EL
TIEMPO ARTICLE.

   STATE SECURITY RECOGNI ED ESCOBAR'S VOICE IN A CONVERSATION
INTERCEPTED DURING A ROUTINE RADIO SCANNING OPERATION, WHICH REVEALED
THAT THE CARTEL WAS PLANNING TO SURRENDER TO THE GOVERNMENT.  ESCOBAR
WAS ACTING AS THE CARTEL'S INTERMEDIARY IN CHARGE OF CONTACTING LAWYER
GUIDO PARRA, THE LIAISON BETWEEN THE CARTEL AND HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.  ESCOBAR DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE OFFICIALS
INVOLVED.

   A NATIONAL POLICE INTELLIGENCE REPORT SAYS THAT OCHOA AND ESCOBAR
FIND THEMSELVES IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION BECAUSE OTHER TRAFFICKER
GROUPS HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT AS THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR KIDNAPPINGS AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTS THEY HAVE NOT
PERPETRATED.  THE REPORT FURTHER INDICATES THAT ESCOBAR, PRESSURED BY
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ANTIOQUIA, "WAS FORCED TO ORDER THE KIDNAPPINGS
OF ALVARO DIEGO MONTOYA, (SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
PRESIDENCY) AND PATRICIA ECHEVARRIA (SISTER OF PRESIDENT BARCO'S
SON-IN-LAW) AND HER DAUGHTER."  THESE HIGH PROFILE HOSTAGES SERVED AS
A "PROTECTIVE SHIELD," ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE.

   SPOKESMEN FOR THE INTELLIGENCE CORPS ARE QUOTED AS SAYING THAT
ESCOBAR KNEW THAT BY TAKING HOSTAGE THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL
OF THE PRESIDENCY, HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY EXERT THE PRESSURE HE NEEDED
TO ACT IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES."  PROBLEMS BEGAN TO SURFACE
SOON AFTER THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER, AS MEMBERS AT ODDS WITH ESCOBAR
STARTED TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE GROUP.  ACCORDING TO MEDELLIN
OFFICIALS, THE KIDNAPPINGS OF MONTOYA AND ECHEVARRIA ALSO HAD AN
IMPACT ON THE RATE OF ATTRITION AMONG THE "EXTRADITABLES.

   THE CARTEL'S SURRENDER IS NOT SEEN AS A SURPRISE: THE 4TH ARMY
BRIGADE WAS CONDUCTING AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH OF THE ANTIOQUIA
DEPARTMENT IN AN EFFORT TO BRING THE KINGPINS TO JUSTICE.  MOREOVER,
THE ARMY LAUNCHED A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AMONG THE LOCALS TO ENCOURAGE
THEM TO INFORM AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF
JOSE GON ALO RODRIGUE GACHA, ESCOBAR AND OCHOA WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE
MOVE.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR STATE SECURITY STATES THAT SOPHISTICATED
COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT IN MEDELLIN ENABLED THEM TO LEARN ABOUT
ESCOBAR'S INTENTIONS ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
ESTABLISH THEIR EXACT WHEREABOUTS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY NEVER
REMAINED IN ONE PLACE FOR MORE THAN SIX HOURS AT A TIME.  THE TWO DRUG
BARONS ALWAYS TRAVELED WITH AN ESCORT OF SIX TO EIGHT MEN WHOM THEY
TRUSTED IMPLICITLY.

   ACCORDING TO A HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICIAL, "WHEN ESCOBAR BEGAN
LOSING POWER IN MEDELLIN, HIS CLOSEST AIDES, FEARING PERSECUTION, WENT
INTO HIDING."  HE ADDS THAT ESCOBAR AND OCHOA TOOK ON THE CAUSE OF
TRAFFICKERS WANTED BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT NOTES, "WE ARE WELL AWARE
OF THE FACT THAT THE CALI CARTEL MEN DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY."

   THE EL TIEMPO ARTICLE NOTES THAT ON 19 JANUARY SEVERAL LEADING
COLOMBIAN NEWSPAPERS CIRCULATED A NOTICE POINTING TO ESCOBAR AS THE
MAN WHO ACTS IN THE NAME OF THE "EXTRADITABLES."  LATER, IT WAS
CONFIRMED THAT THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE NOTICE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A
DEMENTED PERSON WHOSE NAME HAD CLEARLY BEEN USED.  EL TIEMPO ASKS:.
"COULD THIS BE A MESSAGE FROM OTHER DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO ARE UNWILLING
TO PAY FOR PABLO ESCOBAR'S ACTIONS?  COULD IT BE A MESSAGE FROM THESE
SAME TRAFFICKERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THIS BUSINESS AND
THEREFORE ARE UNWILLING TO HAVE ESCOBAR AND OCHOA SPEAK FOR THEM?"
