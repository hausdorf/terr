 SALVADORAN,
CENTRAL AMERICAN, LATIN AMERICAN BROTHERS: YOU ARE LISTENING TO RADIO
VENCEREMOS, THE VOICE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH DETERMINATION
TO ATTAIN DEMOCRACY.  WE REPORT TO OUR FIGHTERS THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
TUNE IN, TO ALL OUR PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THAT THE FLMN
 FORCES HAVE CONDUCTED MORE
THAN 18 HOURS OF HEROIC COMBAT IN SAN SALVADOR, THE COUNTRY'S MAIN
CITIES, AND IN THE HIGHWAYS.  AT THIS POINT, OUR MEN HAVE DOWNED TWO
HELICOPTERS AND DESTROYED THREE MORE HELICOPTERS THAT WERE ON LAND.
THIS BRINGS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HELICOPTERS TAKEN OUT OF COMBAT TO
FIVE.  WE HAVE ALSO DAMAGED TWO MORE ARMY ARMED VEHICLES AND THIS
BRINGS THE TOTAL TO HALF A DOZEN.  THESE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.
WE HAVE ALSO DESTROYED 12 LIGHT TANKS.  OUR PERSONNEL HAVE TAKEN
CONTROL OF THE MUNICIPAL MAYORS' OFFICES IN SEVERAL PLACES THROUGHTOUT
THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY.  ALSO, IN SAN SALVADOR WE
HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL PRISONERS OF WAR.  THEY ARE PART OF THE REPRESSIVE
FORCES OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AND THE BELLOSO BATTALION.  WE HAVE ALSO
CONFISCATED A LARGE SUPPLY OF WAR MATERIEL FROM THE FASCISTS ENEMY
FORCES.  THESE WEAPONS ARE NOW IN THE HANDS OF OUR PEOPLE AND ARE NOW
GOING TO BE USED TO SHOOT THE FASCISTS.  THESE WEAPONS ARE IN THE
HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO USE THEM TO ATTAIN JUSTICE FOR THE
MURDERS OF FEBE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, OTHER COOPERATIVISTS, THE TEN
UNION LEADERS, AND MSGR ARNULFO ROMERO.  THESE WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF
THE PEOPLE ARE A GUARANTEE FOR JUSTICE, DEMOCRACY, AND PEACE.

   ATTENTION, ATTENTION, THIS IS LAST MINUTE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN
RECEIVED BY RADIO VENCEREMOS.  ATTENTION SALVADORANS AND PRESS
AGENCIES THAT ARE MONITORING OUR GUERRILLA RADIO STATION.  WE HAVE
RECEIVED REPORTS THAT BOMBINGS CONTINUE IN SAN SALVADOR.
INDISCRMINATE BOMBING CONTINUES IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE HAVE RECEIVED
REPORTS OF INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING IN ZACAMIL, SOYAPANGO, AND SAN
MARCOS NEIGHBORHOODS.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THESE AREAS.  THESE
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE DENSELY POPULATED.  WE ALSO RECEIVED THE REPORT THAT
A DEATH SQUAD HEADED BY COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES HAS AGAIN
TAKEN ACTIONS AGAINST A CIVILIAN POPULATION JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE
UNABLE TO COMBAT OUR PERSONNEL.  THIS SQUAD ENTERED THE SALVADORAN
UNIVERSITY FROM THE AREA WHERE THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS LOCATED.
WE MUST NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS NEAR THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE
HEADQUARTERS.  THEY CAPTURED 13 CIVILIANS, BLINDFOLDED, TIED, AND TOOK
THEM INTO THAT MILITARY HEADQUARTERS.  ELENA FUENTES -- THAT
REPUDIABLE MURDERER, THAT ASSASSIN GORRILLA -- COWARDLY ATTACKS THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION AS HE IS UNABLE TO COMBAT THE PEOPLE'S ARMED
PERSONNEL.  FUENTES IS UNABLE TO STRIKE BACK SO HE ATTACKS MOTHERS AND
UNION MEMBERS.  THIS IS WHAT THIS TWO-BIT COLONEL IS ACCUSTOMED TO
DOING.  HE STRIKES OUT AT THE PEOPLE.  LET HIM COME OUT AND FIGHT THE
REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR.  OUR PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF DEATH
SQUADS, POVERTY, REPRESSION, AND FASCIST TOTALITARIANISM.  WE ARE
TOTALLY DECIDED AND FIRMLY DETERMINED TO OVERCOME THE FASCIST
LATANDONA OFFICERS .  SALVADORAN PEOPLE: AS ONE STRONG FIST, LET
US ALL JOIN TOGETHER AND STRIKE THE FASCISTS.  LET'S TAKE IT TO THE
HILT.
