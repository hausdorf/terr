  COMRADE VILLALOBOS  REFERRED TO THE
BOMBINGS AND THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  THIS IS THE QUESTION
HE WAS ASKED: IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PRESSURED THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE
BOMBINGS AND THE BLOODSHED IN OUR HOMELAND.  HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE KILLED IN SAN
SALVADOR.  THEREFORE, WHAT IS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE BOMBINGS?  WHAT
INTENTION DID THE ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF HAVE IN KILLING THE
JESUITS?  COMMANDER VILLALOBOS REPLIED:

     FIRST, IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE
KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WAS A HARSH
BLOW TO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR AN EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.
THE JESUIT PRIESTS ARE A SECTOR OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY THAT HAS MADE
AND CONTINUES TO MAKE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PEOPLE'S EDUCATION.
THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO DEBATE, THE NEED TO REASON THINGS OUT, AND THE
NEED TO HAVE POLITICAL PLURALISM.

   HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE  SECTORS, AND MR. CRISTIANI CANNOT STAND INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE, THE DEBATES, THE ANALYSES, AND THE PEOPLE'S REASONING.  THIS
IS WHY THEY COMMITTED THIS CRIME.

   THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME BECOMES EVIDENT, NOT ONLY BASED
ON DIRECT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE FACT THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY
UNIFORMED MEN DURING THE CURFEW PERIOD AND THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE
CRIME A GROUP OF MILITARY MEN CHECKED OUT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE
GOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME -- CLEARLY INTENDING TO PREPARE A PLAN --
BUT BECAUSE OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE JESUITS MADE OVER THE NATIONAL
NETWORK.  WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS CRIME WAS A POLITICAL
MISTAKE MADE BY THE DICTATORSHIP.  IT WAS A MISCALCULATION ON THE PART
OF THOSE WHO MADE THAT DECISION.

   WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO
STOP THE FMLN.  THEY COULD NOT STOP THE FMLN PLAN.  ONCE WE BEGAN TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN  A VERY CRITICAL
SITUATION.

   WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS CRITICAL SITUATION, THEY TOOK THE
WRONG STEP.  THE DAY BEFORE THE CRIME THE ARMED FORCES BEGAN A
STRATEGY TO WEAR OUT THE FMLN, LOGISTICALLY.  WE MUST NOT IGNORE THE
FACT THAT THE ARMED FORCES' CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION
THAT THE FMLN FORCES WOULD BECOME EXHAUSTED.  WE WOULD HAVE MADE A
SERIOUS MISTAKE IF WE HAD BEGUN THIS PLAN WITHOUT FORESEEING ALL THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES BASED THEIR CALCULATIONS ON
OUR POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION.

   CONSEQUENTLY, BASED ON THOSE CALCULATIONS, THEY FIGURED THAT THEY
HAD 3 OR 4 DAYS TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK.  SO, THE DAY PRIOR TO THE
KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEY LAUNCHED SEVERAL OFFENSIVES -- I
RATHER CALL THEM COUNTEROFFENSIVES -- TO TRY TO DISLODGE US FROM OUR
POSITIONS.  THEIR TACTIC WAS TO MAKE US WASTE AMMUNITION.  THEY WERE
NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE US ABANDON OUR POSITIONS YET.

   HOWEVER, OUR FIGHTERS, IN ADDITION TO SAVING OUR AMMUNITION, HAVE
THE MATERIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES SO THEY INFLICTED MANY CASUALTIES ON
THE ARMED FORCES AND WORE THEM OUT.  BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ARMED
FORCES DID NOT REALIZE THAT AND FELT THAT THEY COULD LAUNCH A BIG
COUNTERATTACK TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN FORCES.  BASED ON THAT, THEY CAME
UP WITH A PLAN THAT WAS NOT ONLY MILITARY BUT POLITICAL.   THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, THE U.S. ADVISERS, THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, AND WHO KNOWS WHO ELSE WERE INFORMED ABOUT THIS PLAN.
THEY MADE THE WRONG INTERPRETATION OF THE CALLS MADE BY THE
INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS ON THE
NEED TO HAVE A TRUCE TO EVACUATE CIVILIANS.  THEY THOUGHT THAT WE MADE
THESE CALLS AND BASED ON THAT, THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD PROCEED TO A
COUNTEROFFENSIVE.

   BASED ON THAT, LET US ANALYZE THE PROPAGANDA AND INFORMATION
DISSEMINATED ON THE DAY PRIOR TO THE KILLING OF THE JESUITS.  THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR HIMSELF EXPLAINED A WAR REPORT AND GAVE AN UPDATE ON THE
SITUATION.  THUS, THEY THOUGHT THAT THE FMLN WAS GOING TO SUFFER A
GREAT POLITICAL AND MILITARY DEFEAT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  THEY HAD
AN OVERALL PLAN.
