 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (CICR) HAS DECLARED THAT THE
CICR HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENTER THE AREAS AFFECTED BY LAST NIGHT'S
FIERCE FIGHTING AND BOMBING "BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES FROM THE
GOVERNMENT."

   MARIE AUDE LUDE, CICR SPOKESWOMAN IN EL SALVADOR TOLD ACAN - EFE
THAT "WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REPLY FROM THE AUTHORITIES REGARDING
OUR REQUEST FOR A 6-HOUR TRUCE MADE ON 15 NOVEMBER."

   SHE SAID THAT, "WE CAN NOT OPERATE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES."

   SHE SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE SALVADORAN RED CROSS HAS BEEN ACTIVE.
SHE CONFIRMED THAT FIVE OF ITS AMBULANCES HAVE BEEN SHOT AT SINCE THE
FIGHTING BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE ARMY STARTED IN THE STREETS OF
SAN SALVADOR ON 11 NOVEMBER.

   THREE MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL RED CROSS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN THE LAST
5 DAYS.

   INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS ARRIVING FROM THE ZACAMIL AND MEJICANOS
NEIGHBORHOODS THIS MORNING REPORTED THAT THERE WERE MANY CASUALTIES
DURING LAST NIGHT'S FIGHTING. THEY SAID THAT THE AIR FORCE
CONTINUOUSLY MACHINEGUNNED GUERRILLA POSITIONS IN THE DENSLY POPULATED
AREAS.

   THE CICR HAS ASKED THE TWO SIDES TO DECREE A 6-HOUR TRUCE TO
EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND BURY THE MANY BODIES THAT ARE SPREAD
THROUGOUT THE CITY.  SOME CORPSES ARE DECAYING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT
DURING THE DAY IN THIS CITY.
