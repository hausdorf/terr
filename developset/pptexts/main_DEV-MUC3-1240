  ROLANDO GONZALEZ, LOS ANGELES TIMES.

    MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO MAKE A QUESTION THAT WAS MADE IN
SPANISH BEFORE AND IT'S RELATED ABOUT COLONEL OCHOA PEREZ.  HE HAS BEEN A
HARD-LINE MILITARY AND DON'T YOU THINK THAT HIS  GOT TO BE
POSSIBLE?  THIS IS ONE AND I GOT A SECOND ONE.  CAN YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE RELATION WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND WHAT
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RECENT MACHINEGUN TRAFFIC OF THE GUERRILLAS?

    WELL, WITH THE FIRST CASE MY OPINION IS THAT ANYBODY THAT HAS
ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS
SHOULD -- INSTEAD OF SPECULATE WITH IT PUBLICLY -- SHOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE
COURT THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE AND GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE
TO HIM OR THAT HE IS KNOWLEDGEABLE OF, AND THEN HAVE THE JUDGE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

   I THINK THAT MERE SPECULATION IN PUBLIC IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
GOOD FOR THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BECAUSE IT CREATES PROBLEMS FOR IT.
SECONDLY, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A HIGH-RANKING OFFICER, IN CASES LIKE
THIS, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE OPINION OF A SPECIFIC MEMBER OF THE
ARMED FORCES IS ONE WHICH IS TOTALLY TRUE OR TOTALLY FALSE .  YOU CANNOT SIMPLY GO BY THAT AS A WAY TO SIMPLY STATE THAT
HIS STATEMENTS ARE TRUE.

   IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT WHEREAS BEFORE NO ONE REALLY
WOULD BELIEVE COL. OCHOA, ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE WANTS TO GIVE HIM
ALL THE CREDIBILITY IN THIS CASE.  I AM NOT SAYING THAT WHAT HE SAID
IS TRUE OR UNTRUE.  MY POINT IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DEBATED
PUBLICLY; THAT ANYBODY -- COL. OCHOA, MEMBERS OF THE JESUIT COMMUNITY,
OR ANYBODY ELSE -- WHO HAS ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL
SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE AND GIVE HIM THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE HELPING THE PROCESS AND NOT MERE SPECULATIONS IN PUBLIC.

   WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, WE DISCUSSED THIS
WITH ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF MRS. CHAMORRO DURING OUR VISIT AND WE
DECIDED TO INITIATE  PLANS AND,
THEREFORE, WE ARE WILLING TO REINITIATE THE PROCESS.  HER ADVISER WAS
VERY CLEAR TO STATE THAT THEY WILL BY NO MEANS AID THE FMLN IN THAT
RESPECT.

   WE THINK THAT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN THE 25TH OF FEBRUARY
AND THE 25TH OF APRIL IS THAT THE FMLN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET
ALL THAT WAS LEFT IN NICARAGUA.... THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT; THANK YOU, MR.
FOREIGN MINISTER.  JOURNALISTS, THANK YOU.
