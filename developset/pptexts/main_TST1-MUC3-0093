 WE WILL ORGANIZE
A PLURALIST GOVERNMENT WHICH INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE
PATRIOTIC GROUPS OF THE NATION.  LET US SAVE OUR CAPITAL, WHICH IS
BEING BOMBED DUE TO A FOREIGN MENTALITY.  IT IS BEING BOMBED AND
DESTROYED BY AN OCCUPATION ARMY.  THE AIRPLANES ARE NOW BEING FLOWN BY
U.S. PILOTS AT NIGHT, AND THEY HAVE THE MENTALITY OF AN OCCUPATION
ARMY.

   SALVADORANS, LET US UNITE AND ORGANIZE OURSELVES.  LET US NOT
REMAIN IDLE.  WE MUST MOBILIZE OURSELVES RIGHT NOW AND ORGANIZE A
COMMITTEE IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.  THE
PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE.  THE FMLN HAS BEGUN ITS 7TH DAY IN THE CAPITAL,
AND WE ARE SURE THAT WE ARE ADVANCING TOWARD VICTORY.  VICTORY WILL BE
OURS AND COLONEL PONCE HAS GIVEN PROOF OF HIS DESPERATION WITH THE
JESUIT PRIESTS' ASSASSINATION IN SAN SALVADOR.  HE HAS OVERSTEPPED HIS
MARK AND THE PEOPLE'S PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED.  WE URGE ALL OUR PEOPLE
TO JOIN THE GENERAL UPRISING, STRUGGLE, TAKE UP WEAPONS, AND ORGANIZE
EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO OUST THIS CORRUPT AND MURDEROUS REGIME.  WE
URGE THE PEOPLE TO MOBILIZE,TO TAKE UP WEAPONS, AND TO STAY IN THE
NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS TO STRUGGLE FOR THE LIBERATION OF
OUR HOMELAND.  WE MUST ACHIEVE PROGRESS.

   INFORMATION HAS JUST ARRIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES, INDICATING
THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO WITHDRAW ITS UNCONDITIONAL
SUPPORT FOR THE DEATH SQUADS IN EL SALVADOR.  INFORMATION RECEIVED
FROM THE UNITED STATES INDICATES THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO
RECANT ITS IRRESPONSIBLE AND GENOCIDAL ATTITUDE OF SENDING U.S.
PILOTS TO BOMB OUR CAPITAL BY NIGHT.  THAT IS THE PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING THAT U.S. IMPERIALISM IS CURRENTLY GIVING THE ARMED FORCES,
MEANING TO BOMB THE CAPITAL BY NIGHT, AS ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL
HAVE WITNESSED IN RECENT HOURS.

   THUS, WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE: ORGANIZE YOURSELVES.  WE
WILL ACHIEVE VICTORY.  WE SURE OF THIS.  THE BLOOD OF IGNACIO
ELLACURIA, THE BLOOD OF THE JESUITS, THE BLOOD OF MONSIGNOR 
ROMERO, THE BLOOD OF THE FOUR U.S. NUNS, THE BLOOD OF THE 11 PRIESTS
ASSASSINATED , THE BLOOD OF 
SEMINARIANS, YOUTHS , AND FOR ALL THE BLOOD SHED.
WE MUST WIN, WE MUST ACHIEVE VICTORY, WE MUST ATTAIN A TRUE DEMOCRACY
FOR OUR HOMELAND -- A DEMOCRACY WITH FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, FOOD,
EDUCATION, AND JUSTICE.
