 A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT
WAS SPECULATED THAT CHANGES OF COMMAND IN CERTAIN ARMED FORCES KEY POSTS
WOULD TAKE PLACE LATE IN 1989.

   COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF, DISREGARDED THIS
POSSIBILITY AND SAID THAT THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY,
PARTICULARLY SINCE THE FMLN 
OFFENSIVE, REQUIRES, MORE THAN EVER, THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE MILITARILY
STABLE.

     I THINK THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY
DEMANDS MILITARY STABILITY.  CHANGES COULD PROVOKE SOME UNREST.  WE
THINK NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MILITARY COMMAND SHOULD BE MADE AT
PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION.  SHOULD ANY CHANGES BE MADE,
IT WOULD BE FOR MAJOR REASONS IN THE SERVICE. NO HIGH-LEVEL CHANGES
HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED, HOWEVER. 

   REFERRING TO THE REBELS' ACTIVITIES, COL PONCE SAID THE ARMED
ACTIONS INITIATED, PARTICULARLY IN SAN SALVADOR ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAVE
ENDED WITH UNFAVORABLE RESULTS FOR THE GUERRILLAS.  HE ADVISED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLAS WILL CONTINUE TO SABOTAGE THE COUNTRY'S
ECONOMY AND PERPETRATE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

     I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED,
MILITARILY SPEAKING.  THE FMLN'S FAMOUS ALL - THE - WAY OFFENSIVE HAS
ENDED IN TREMENDOUS FAILURE, DETERMINED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE
CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THE FMLN WILL CONTINUE ITS SABOTAGING ACTIONS AND
TERRORISM WHICH COULD DESTROY STORES IN SAN SALVADOR, AS WELL AS POSTS
AND PYLONS ON HIGHWAYS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE CAN REST ASSURED,
HOWEVER, THAT AN OFFENSIVE ACTION BY THE FMLN AT PRESENT CAN BE
DISREGARDED. 

   REGARDING THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR FESTIVITIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN
MARRED BY THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED WHETHER THE
2300 - TO - 0500 CURFEW IS STILL IN FORCE.  PONCE SAID THE POSSIBILITY
OF LIFTING THE CURFEW AT LEAST ON 24 AND 31 DECEMBER IS BEING
CONSIDERED SO THAT THE SALVADORAN FAMILIES CAN ENJOY THESE
FESTIVITIES.  HE ADDED THAT SUCH A MEASURE, HOWEVER, WILL DEPEND ON
THE FMLN'S STANCE.  FINALLY, PONCE REPORTED THAT THE FMLN
MACHINEGUNNED A BUILDING WITH COFFEE HARVESTERS IN SANTA ANA AND
MAIMED TWO PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO STOP HARVESTING
COFFEE.
