### Preprocessing Data

In order to do these experiments, you must preprocess the data. To do this:

1. Unzip Ellens data. This should produce a directory developset/.
2. Put this directory in the same directory as `preprocess.py`. Create a directory: `developset/pptexts/`. This is where `preprocess.py` will drop the "processed" data.
3. Run `python preprocess.py`.
