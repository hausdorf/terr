   BUENOS AIRES, 21 APR 90 (DYN) -- [TEXT] DEFENSE MINISTER HUMBERTO
ROMERO SAID TODAY THAT ARGENTINA HAS "SUSPENDED AND FROZEN" THE
"CONDOR" MISSILE PROJECT.  HE ALSO DENIED INTERNATIONAL PRESS REPORTS
THAT THE MISSILE WAS BEING BUILT IN SECRET WITH IRAQ FOR POTENTIAL USE
AGAINST ISRAEL.

   DURING A MEETING WITH REPORTERS THIS AFTERNOON, ROMERO SAID: "THE
PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF A POLITICAL DECISION, AND ALSO
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE FUNDS TO FINANCE THIS TECHNICAL PROJECT."

   THIS IS HOW THE MINISTER IMPLICITLY ALLUDED TO THE REPEATED PRESS
REPORTS FROM EUROPE, THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MIDDLE EAST ABOUT
ARGENTINE PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ONE OF THE STAGES OF
THE IRAQI MISSILE SYSTEM.

   ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION IRAQ, ISRAEL, OR THE
REPORT ON THE MISSILE, ROMERO SAID: "WE WANT TO PUT THIS TO REST IN
THE FACE OF PUBLICATIONS THAT APPEAR IN THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS EVERY
SO OFTEN."  HE ADDED: "WE ALWAYS SAID THE PROJECT NEVER REPRESENTED
ANY RISK OR DANGER FOR ANYONE, BUT AT ANY RATE THE PROJECT WAS
SUSPENDED, IT IS FROZEN."

   THIS WEEK IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN SAID HIS COUNTRY CAN WAGE
A TOTAL WAR AGAINST ISRAEL THROUGH THE USE OF MEDIUM-RANGE STRATEGIC
MISSILES THAT CAN REPORTEDLY CARRY CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  HUSSEIN ALSO
SAID ANY ISRAELI EFFORT TO BOMB THE IRAQI MISSILE MANAUFACTURING
PLANTS WOULD BE FUTILE BECAUSE "OUR MISSILES ARE MADE IN PARTS IN
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD."

   ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS THE
MANUFACTURER, IN COOPERATION WITH EGYPT AND IRAQ, OF MEDIUM-RANGE --
ABOUT 800 KM -- BALLISTIC MISSILES.  EACH TIME ARGENTINA HAS
CATEGORICALLY DENIED THIS.  THE ARGENTINE AIR FORCE SUCCESSFULLY
DEVELOPED THE "CONDOR I" AND "CONDOR II" PROJECTS.  IT HAS BEEN
ASSURED THAT THESE ARE FOR PUTTING A DOMESTIC SATELLITE IN ORBIT.

   THE LAST MISSILE TEST WAS MADE JULY L989 AT THE CHAMICAL AIRSPACE
BASE, LA RIOJA PROVINCE, WHERE A STAGE OF THE "CONDOR" MISSILE
TRAVELLED MORE THAT 160 KM.
