   NO CITY (ISRAEL), 25 AUG 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH NETANYAHU BY
FRIEDMAN AND DAN] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [FRIEDMAN] YOU MUST KNOW BETTER
THAN I THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ITSELF, AND NOT ONLY INDIVIDUAL
ISRAELI NATIONALS, ARE ACCUSED OF MAKING SECURITY-RELATED DEALS WITH
VARIOUS REGIMES WHICH -- TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD, AT LEAST --
APPEAR TO BE OF QUESTIONABLE REPUTE.  WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA THAT GUIDE
ISRAEL'S ACTIONS AS A STATE AND WHEN ISSUING PERMITS TO PRIVATE
COMPANIES TO MAKE DEALS WITH SUCH COUNTRIES?

   [NETANYAHU] I WILL NOT GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS CRITERIA
DETERMINED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WHICH ARE OFTEN RELATED TO OUR OWN
DEFENSE ISSUES.  ONE CRITERION, HOWEVER, IS CLEAR:  WE DO NOT ALLOW
COOPERATION WITH ELEMENTS WHICH ARE NOT STATE-AFFILIATED, SUCH AS CARTELS,
GROUPS, OR GANGS.  ALL THESE ARE OFF LIMITS.  THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT
THAT, AND NO GREY AREAS.  THEREFORE, IF THE REPORTS FROM COLOMBIA ARE TRUE,
THE PEOPLE ACTED COUNTER TO OUR POLICY AND IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW.

   [FRIEDMAN] WHAT ABOUT WORKING WITH OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS TO CERTAIN
REGIMES?

   [NETANYAHU] I REPEAT:  STATE MOVEMENTS ONLY, OR, LET US SAY, STATE
REGIMES.  THIS IS OUR POLICY.  ANY OTHER ACTION RUNS COUNTER TO OUR POLICY.

   [DAN] WHEN ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TRAFFICKING IN COLOMBIA IS
MENTIONED, DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF ISRAELIS REFERRED TO?  PERHAPS THE
STATEMENT IS EXAGGERATED, AND THERE ARE NO MORE THAN ONE OR TWO, PERHAPS
THREE ISRAELIS?

   [NETANYAHU] THAT IS A GOOD POINT; REPORTS ARE SO OFTEN BLOWN OUT OF
PROPORTION.  WE SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF REPUTATION WHICH OFTEN LEADS TO
EXAGGERATED AND FANTASTIC -- I DO NOT WISH TO USE THE TERM ROMANTIC --
REPORTS IN THIS CONTEXT.  IN ANY EVENT, THERE ARE MANY REPORTS, AND WE WOULD
LIKE TO GET TO THE CORE OF TRUTH BEHIND THEM.  AFTER THAT, WE WILL DECIDE
WHAT ACTION WE CAN TAKE.  WE MAY TAKE LEGAL STEPS, TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S
PASSPORTS, AND RESORT TO OTHER METHODS.

   [FRIEDMAN] IN THE PAST, MR NETANYAHU, YOU BELONGED TO AN ARMY UNIT IN
WHICH OUR FINEST YOUNG PEOPLE SERVED.  HAVE YOU FOUND FORMER ARMY FRIENDS IN
ANY OF THE MENTIONED NAMES?

   [NETANYAHU] NO, AND I HOPE NEVER TO FIND ANY.  

   [DAN] DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE PHENOMENON?  

   [NETANYAHU] IF IT EXISTS! 

   [FRIEDMAN] YES, IF IT EXISTS.  OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION IS
SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISO, BECAUSE WE HAVE NO SOLID GROUNDS FOR DISCUSSION.

   [NETANYAHU] IF IT EXISTS, I THINK IT REFLECTS THE MORAL CORRUPTION OF A
FEW INDIVIDUALS.  THE STATE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT EACH OF ITS
NATIONALS DOES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  THESE PEOPLE MAY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO
MERCENARY OR OTHER TEMPTATIONS.  THE EXPRESSION OF SELLING ONE'S SOUL TO THE
DEVIL IS APPROPRIATE IN THEIR CASE.

   [FRIEDMAN] DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BINYAMIN NETANYAHU, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.  

   [NETANYAHU] THANK YOU.
