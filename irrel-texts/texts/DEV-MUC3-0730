VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND MAN'S FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES:  THE ENORMOUS
HUMAN SUFFERING CAUSED BY THIS SITUATION HAS RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF

   1. WE URGENTLY CALL ON THE SALVADORAN REGIME TO IMMEDIATELY STOP THE
BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND THE ACTS OF REPRESSION LIKE AT SAN
SALVADOR UNIVERSITY.  

   2.  WE MAKE AN APPEAL SO THAT THE HOSTILITIES CAN BE STOPPED
IMMEDIATELY, THE WOUNDED CAN BE EVACUATED, AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION CAN
BE SUPPLIED WITH STAPLES IN FULL SECURITY.

   3.  WE APPEAL TO THE SIDES IN CONFLICT THAT NEGOTIATIONS BE IMMEDIATELY
INITIATED THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, LEADING TO A CEASE -
FIRE UNDER CONDITIONS THAT ENSURE FULL RESPECT FOR ALL HUMAN RIGHTS.

   4.  WE URGE MAKING THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS SO THE UN OBSERVERS FOR
CENTRAL AMERICA [ONUCA], CREATED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL ON 7 NOVEMBER
1989, CAN GO TO EL SALVADOR IMMEDIATELY TO A) MAKE SURE THERE IS NO
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, WHICH COULD PREVENT THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO FULL AND UNRESTRICTED
SELF-DETERMINATION; B) ENFORCE THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
REGARDING HUMANITARIANISM, PARTICULARLY ARTICLE 3 OF THE GENEVA
CONVENTIONS SIGNED IN 1949, WHICH DEAL WITH EXPENDITURES DUE TO WAR,
PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].

  5.  WE ASK THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL TO UTILIZE ALL AVAILABLE INDIRECT
AND DIRECT MEANS, ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 115 OF THE AMENDED CHARTER, TO
