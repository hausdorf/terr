   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE ARE IN CONTACT
WITH SAN SALVADOR AND WE ARE RECEIVING MORE REPORTS ON THE PERSECUTION
UNLEASHED AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN SAN SALVADOR.

   WE REMIND YOU THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO COLONEL FRANCISCO ELENA FUENTES
AND COLONEL INOCENTE ORLANDO MONTANO LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE
LUTHERAN AND OTHER CHURCHES THROUGHOUT EL SALVADOR.  NOW THIS
CAMPAIGN, ORCHESTRATED BY COL ELENA FUENTES, CHIEF OF THE 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE'S DEATH SQUADS, HAS HEIGHTENED.  NOT ONLY HAVE JESUIT PRIESTS
BEEN MURDERED, BUT THIS MORNING THE NATIONAL GUARD ARRESTED TWO
PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S.  CITIZEN.  WE
REPEAT: TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES HAVE BEEN ARRESTED
INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN.  THESE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED BY THE NATIONAL
GUARD.  WE CALL ON ALL THE [WORD INDISTINCT] AROUND THE WORLD; WE CALL
ON ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SECTORS TO MOBILIZE.  TWO PRIESTS
AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL
GUARD IN SAN SALVADOR.  AMONG THE ARRESTED PERSONS IS A U.S.  CITIZEN.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS IS IN CONTACT WITH SAN SALVADOR TO GATHER MORE
DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE TWO PRIESTS AND
SEVERAL MISSIONARIES, INCLUDING A U.S. CITIZEN, WHO WERE ARRESTED.

   THE PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH CONTINUES BY ARENA [NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] AND THE LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966
GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY]
MILITARY CLIQUE.  RADIO VENCEREMOS CALLS ON ALL THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD, THE
LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, TO MOBILIZE, OCCUPY SALVADORAN EMBASSIES,
DEMONSTRATE IN FRONT OF SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AROUND THE WORLD AND
DEMAND THE RELEASE OF THE PRIESTS WHO WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING BY
THE NATIONAL GUARD.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] 1 MINUTE FOR THE RELIGIOUS
COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD TO SPEAK OUT AND MOBILIZE TO PRESSURE
PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. THIS COULD SAVE THE LIVES OF THE PERSONS ARRESTED
THIS MORNING BY THE NATIONAL GUARD, A BLOODTHIRSTY GUARD THAT IS
RELIVING THE LAST DAYS OF THE SOMOZIST GUARD.  THE KILLING OF PRIESTS
AND NOW THE ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL MISSIONARIES FURTHER
CONFIRMS THAT THE REGIME IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSING, THAT IT IS
DESPERATE AND NO LONGER CARES ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,
PRESSURE, OR REQUESTS FOR AN END TO THE BOMBINGS AND BLOODSHED.  THIS
MORNING'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN THE ARREST OF TWO PRIESTS AND SEVERAL
MISSIONARIES.
