[REPORT] [JULIO MILLER, DIRECTOR OF RPC NEWS DEPARTMENT] [TEXT] DEAR
TELEVISION AUDIENCE, WE BRIEFLY INTERRUPT OUR REGULAR PROGRAMMING TO
OFFER YOU A REPORT OF GENERAL INTEREST.  THE FILM CLIPS WE WILL SEE IN
A FEW MINUTES WERE TAKEN THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY TONIGHT AT THE
RESIDENCY OF THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN BELLA VISTA CORREGIMIENTO, EL
CANGREJO NEIGHBORHOOD, WHEN PEOPLE WERE STAGING A PEACEFUL
DEMONSTRATION PROMPTED BY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO
GRANT SAFE-CONDUCTS TO SOME OF THE PANAMANIANS CURRENTLY AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  AMONG THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT SHELTER AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND WHO WERE GRANTED SAFE-CONDUCTS ARE MARCELA TASON,
FORMER PRIVATE SECRETARY OF OUSTED PANAMANIAN DICTATOR MANUEL ANTONIO.
CAPTAINS HERACLIDES SUCRE, AND GONZALO GONZALEZ, INVOLVED IN THE
KILLING OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI ARE ALSO AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  THE
FILM CLIPS SHOW PART OF THE INTENSE PROTESTS THAT TOOK PLACE NEAR, OR
RATHER ON THE GROUNDS OF THE RESIDENCY OF THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR IN
PANAMA CITY.

   DEMONSTRATORS THREW STONES AT THE EMBASSY WINDOWS AND LATER SET
FIRE TO PART OF THE RESIDENCY INSTALLATIONS.  [CROWD SHOUTS: "THIS
DAMNED THING IS ON FIRE!" THREE TIMES] DURING THE PROTEST NOT ONE OF
THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE THE DIPLOMATIC
QUARTERS.  PERUVIAN DIPLOMATS AND EVEN THE PANAMANIANS WHO SOUGHT
SHELTER AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND WHO WERE AT THE RESIDENCY REMAINED
INSIDE.  PANAMANIAN PUBLIC FORCE UNITS UNSUCESSFULLY TRIED TO CONTROL
DEMONSTRATORS.  DURING THE INCIDENT, A PUBLIC FORCE MEMBER WHO TRIED
TO PREVENT THE INCIDENT WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED.  THESE SCENES WERE
FILMED THIS AFTERNOON AND DURING THE EARLY EVENING HOURS BY OUR
CAMERAMAN JOSE CASIS JR. AND SHOW PART OF THE PROTEST ACTIONS AGAINST
THE RESIDENCY.

   MAJOR EDGARDO LOPEZ GRIMALDO, FORMER DEFENSE FORCES PUBLIC
RELATIONS OFFICER, AND THE OTHER CAPTAINS WE MENTIONED BEFORE ARE
CURRENTLY AT THE RESIDENCY.  LET US LISTEN TO PART OF THE STATEMENTS
BY THE WIDOW OF MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ADELA DE GIROLDI] HE [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] TOLD US
THAT HE WILL TAKE US TO FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND JUSTICE MINISTER RICARDO
ARIAS CALDERON.

   [REPORTER] DID YOU AGREE TO THAT?

   [GIROLDI] I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYONE ELSE KILLED.  I THINK THERE
HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE KILLED.  I BELIEVE THE PRESSURE WE HAVE
EXERTED IS ENOUGH.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WILL BE YOUR POSITION WHEN YOU TALK TO THE
MINISTER?

   [GIROLDI] I WANT THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTION SO THAT
THE PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES TURN THOSE PEOPLE OVER TO THE PANAMANIANS.  I
THINK IT IS A MATTER OF FIRMLY DEMANDING THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT
TURNS THIS PEOPLE OVER TO PANAMA.

   [REPORTER] HOWEVER, IF THERE IS NOT A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE TODAY,
BY THE AUTHORITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHAT MEASURES WILL YOU ADOPT?
WILL YOU CONTINUE PROTESTING?

   [GIROLDI] OF COURSE WE WILL CONTINUE PROTESTING.  WE WILL CONTINUE
PROTESTING BECAUSE THE ONLY THING WE ARE ASKING FOR IS THAT THESE
PEOPLE SURRENDER TO PANAMANIAN JUSTICE SO THE LAW CAN BE ENFORCED
BECAUSE THEY KILLED....[CHANGES THOUGHT] HERACLIDES SUCRE FIRED AT MY
HUSBAND, HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT IT, HE MACHINEGUNNED MY HUSBAND IN COLD
BLOOD.  OTHER OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WHO TOOK PART IN THE 3 OCTOBER
COUP WERE TORTURED, CUT WITH MACHETES. [END RECORDING]

   THE FOLLOWING FILM CLIPS SHOW A DIALOGUE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC GUILLERMO ENDARA, VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND
THE WIDOWS OF OFFICERS AND MILITARYMEN MISSING OR KILLED ON 3 OCTOBER
1989 IN THE ATTEMPTED COUP.  THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT, THE
VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE DEMONSTRATORS WAS POSITIVE.  DEMONSTRATORS
PROMISED TO REMAIN CALM AND WAIT UNTIL PANAMANIAN JUSTICE DETERMINES
THE RESPONSIBILITY, AND ISSUE SENTENCES FOR THOSE CURRENTLY AT THE
PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  LATER ON VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND
PRESIDENT ENDARA MADE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS.  WE WILL LISTEN FIRST
TO STATEMENTS BY VICE PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON.  [CONTINUED]
