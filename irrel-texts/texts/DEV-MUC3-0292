   LA PAZ, 3 JUL 89 (PRESENCIA) -- [TEXT] DAVID ANEZ, LEADER OF THE
BLOC OF CONGRESSMEN FROM BENI DEPARTMENT, SAID YESTERDAY THAT "THE
BENI PEOPLE ARE PERIODICALLY SUFFERING RETALIATORY ATTACKS BY UMOPAR
[MOBILE UNITS FOR RURAL AREAS] AND DEA AGENTS, WHO ARE ACTIVELY
ENGAGED IN REPRESSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POLULATION, NOT
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS."  ANEZ MADE THESE REMARKS WHILE COMMENTING
ON LAST WEEK'S INCIDENTS IN SANTA ANA DE YACUMA.

   ANEZ CHARGED THAT THE ATTACKS ARE PERPETRATED AGAINST "OPEN, PEACEFUL
CIVILIANS; THAT IS, AGAINST CITIZENS WHO ARE IN NO WAY INVOLVED IN THE DRUG
TRADE.  NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE MURDERED OR HARASSED IN WAYS NOT IN KEEPING
WITH THE DEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY."

   ANEZ SAID THE PEOPLE OF SANTA ANA ARE RESTLESS AND THAT ALL BENI
DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALERT TO DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RECENT INCIDENTS.

   ANEZ ANNOUNCED THAT, AS LEADER OF THE BENI CONGRESSIONAL BLOC, HE SENT A
LETTER TO PRESIDENT VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO IN WHICH HE OUTLINES THE ISSUE THE
GOVERNMENT MUST ADDRESS TO PREVENT FURTHER CLASHES BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND
SECURITY FORCES.

   ANEZ SAID THE GOVERNMENT MUST ADDRESS THE ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE IN BENI
DEPARTMENT FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND INTERNATIONAL
STANDPOINTS BECAUSE THE DRUG TRADE GOES BEYOND BENI BORDERS; IT IS AN
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY THAT HAS BUILT AN ECONOMIC EMPIRE FAR MORE POWERFUL
THAN THE BENI PEOPLE, ALL BOLIVIANS, AND THAN THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF.
