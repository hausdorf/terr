   PYONGYANG (NORTH KOREA), 4 AUG 89 (KCNA) -- [TEXT] A LETTER TO THE
GREAT LEADER PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG WAS ADOPTED AT A MEETING FOR
SOLIDARITY WITH THE KOREAN PEOPLE HELD IN LIMA, PERU, ON JULY 19.

   IN THE NAME OF THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE, IT CONDEMNED THE U.S.  IMPERIALISTS
WHO UNLEASHED ON JUNE 25, 1950, A WAR OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THE
NEWLY-FOUNDED DPRK WHICH WAS PURSUING A PEACE POLICY.

   THE U.S. IMPERIALISTS ADOPTED IN THE WAR THE SCORCHED EARTH TACTICS BY
INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING, BUT THEY COULD NOT BRING TO THEIR KNEES THE KOREAN
PEOPLE GUIDED BY THE RESPECTED MARSHAL KIM IL-SONG, THE FOUNDER OF THE GREAT
CHUCHE IDEA AND IRON-WILLED BRILLIANT COMMANDER, THE LETTER NOTED, ADDING:

   THE U.S. IMPERIALISTS SUFFERED THE MOST SERIOUS DEFEAT AND IGNONIMITY IN
THEIR HISTORY OF AGGRESSION, WHILE MARSHAL KIM IL-SONG, THE IRON-WILLED
BRILLIANT COMMANDER, DEFEATED THEM AND OPENED A ROAD OF LIBERATION TO THE
PEOPLE.

   IT SUPPORTED THE PROPOSALS FOR THE INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION
OF KOREA ADVANCED BY PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG AND DEMANDED THAT THE U.S.
IMPERIALIST WITHDRAW ARMED FORCES AND NUCLEAR BASES FROM SOUTH KOREA.

   THE LETTER WISHED PRESIDENT KIM IL-SONG GOOD HEALTH AND LONG LIFE.
