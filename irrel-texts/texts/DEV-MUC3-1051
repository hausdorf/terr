EXPULSION YESTERDAY BY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT.

   DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER JUAN MANUEL CASTULOVICH ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY

RELATIONS WITH PERU, AND INSISTED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY, WHERE 11
OF NORIEGA'S AIDES HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE, "IS ASSURED OF ALL THE
DIPLOMATIC GUARANTEES."

"WILL NOT ISSUE SAFE-CONDUCTS TO INDIVIDUALS ACCUSED AS COMMON
CRIMINALS."

   AMONG THE REFUGEES ARE FOUR OFFICERS OF THE DISBANDED PANAMA
DEFENSE FORCES.  ONE OF THEM, HERACLIDES SUCRE, HAS BEEN LINKED BY
PANAMA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL ROGELIO CRUZ TO THE MURDER OF MAJOR MOISES
