   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE LEARNED
THAT THE GENERAL STAFF HAS ERECTED A HUMAN WALL, ERECTED BY COLONEL

THIS MORNING ON THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS.  IT WAS REPORTED THAT
HUNDREDS OF LITTLE SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN PLACED AS CANNON FODDER OUTSIDE
THE GENERAL STAFF INSTALLATIONS.  THIS GIVES US NEW INTELLIGENCE DATA
ON THE MORALE OF COL PONCE, HOW THE CRISIS IS AFFECTING HIM.  WITHOUT
ANY MILITARY CRITERION, HE HAS PLACED A WALL OF SOLDIERS AROUND THE
GENERAL STAFF INSTALATIONS.  THIS IS A GOOD PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE
GIVEN TO US BY COL PONCE, CONCERNING HIS PHYSICAL STATE AND CONCERNING
THE UPSET BEING SUFFERED BY THE STRATEGIC ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF
COMMAND.

   WE CALL ON THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY CLUB, THE MAQUILIGUAS,
SAN BENITO, AND ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS TO IMMEDIATELY ABANDON THAT
COMBAT ZONE.  THE FIGHTING WILL GET WORSE AND THE AIR FORCE WILL BOMB
THE FMLN POSITIONS IN SAN BENITO AND ESCALON NEIGHBORHOODS, THEREFORE
ITS INHABITANTS ARE URGED TO ABANDON THAT RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN SAN
SALVADOR.
