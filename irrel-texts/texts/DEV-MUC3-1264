   SAN SALVADOR, 3 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] HOWEVER, THE FMLN IDEA THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW
FORCE HERE, OR THERE, OR SOMEWHERE IS NOT LOGICAL.  THE IMPORTANT
POINT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE AND
TRANQUILITY.  THEREFORE, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT THEY MAY HAVE
1,000, 2,000, OR 100.  THAT DOES NOT MATTER.  I THINK THAT, WHETHER
THEY HAVE A HIGH OR A LOW MORALE OR WHATEVER, WITH JUST 100 RADICALS
THEY COULD KILL PEOPLE AND DESTROY SOURCES OF EMPLOYMENT.  IN SUM,
THEY CAUSE PANIC AND TERROR IN SOME HAMLETS.  I BELIEVE THAT HAS TO BE
STOPPED.  IT IS NOT A MATTER OF WHO SHOWS FORCE AND WHO DOES NOT.
REGARDLESS OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF FORCE THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT, WE
STILL BELIEVE THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, THE MILITARY VICTORY BY THE
GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT IS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A
STRONG MORAL SUPPORT.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE
AND HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THE
SYSTEM AND THE GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHO IS HEADING IT, NOT JUST A
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.  HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT THE POINT.  WE DO NOT
WANT THIS CONFLICT TO LAST 10 YEARS LONGER, WITH MORE BLOODSHED.
THEREFORE, WE ARE SEARCHING FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE IN IT, NOT BECAUSE IT SUITS US BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONGER OR
NOT STRONGER.

   [MODERATOR] JAMES LOHMAN.

   [LOHMAN] MR. PRESIDENT, WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY AID, HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE
POSSIBILITY OF SEEKING MILITARY AID IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON THIS
CONTINENT OR FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD?  FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT
A COUNTRY LIKE ISRAEL HAS GIVEN MILITARY AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN
COUNTRIES.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY?

   [CRISTIANI] I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT, YES, CERTAINLY, THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS THE DUTY OF DEFENDING THE SYSTEM AND
THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY
HAPPEN, AND WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT OCCUR -- IF THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL
ALWAYS HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATE RESOURCES FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE
COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  A FEW DAYS AGO I LISTENED TO
STATEMENTS BY SOME POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER SECTORS, WHO
COMPLAINED BECAUSE I SAID: WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDING THE
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, WE HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCES, AND THERE ARE
OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO GET RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL DEFENSE.  THOSE
POLITICIANS SAID IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO AFFECT SOCIAL PROGRAMS TO
HELP THE NEEDY.  THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT THOSE POLITICIANS SHOULD THINK
ABOUT WHEN THEY ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN AID.  I BELIEVE THAT IS
SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT NEGLECT.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST DEFEND
THE SYSTEM FROM POSSIBLE ATTACKS -- THROUGH VIOLENCE TO REACH POWER --
WHICH HAS BEEN TERMED BY CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MANY
COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ILLEGAL.

   [LOHMAN] HAVE YOU CONSIDERED [WORDS INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE TAKING INTO
CONSIDERATION SOME ALTERNATIVES.  HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE
THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DEFENSELESS.

   [MODERATOR] WE WILL NOW HAVE QUESTIONS IN ENGLISH.  TOM GIBBS FROM
THE BBC.

   [GIBBS] WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT OF CUTTING U.S.  MILITARY AID?  AND ALSO
IT SEEMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS PUT AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE
CONTINUATION OF AID THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] JESUITS' CASE, AND ALSO THE
CLEANING UP OF THE OFFICERS CORPS OF THE ARMY, OR CHANGES IN THE MILITARY.
HOW INCONVENIENT WOULD IT BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, OR HOW [WORDS INDISTINCT]
IT WOULD BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO [WORDS INDISTINCT]?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I THINK THAT, FIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECT OF THE REDUCTION
OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD.  ON THE FIRST HAND, I THINK IT WOULD BE A
NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END
TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED, AND THAT
A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF
THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT,
THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.  AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT
MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE CONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL
DIALOGUE.  SECONDLY, OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO
DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND
WILL NOT STAND BY WITH A WEAKENED DEFENSE.  THEREFORE, THIS MEANS
REALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS --
SOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC, OR POLITICAL PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN
HAVE ACCESS TO, AND OBVIOUSLY TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES.
THUS, IT WOULD HAVE A TWOFOLD IMPACT IF THAT WAS THE CASE.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN THE CASE OF
THE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ONGOING.  IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ME [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TO THINK THAT BEFORE IT HAS ENDED, THAT THERE IS
PREJUDGEMENT ON WHAT THE RESULTS WOULD BE.  I THINK THAT THE JUDGE, AS
I SAID EARLIER, HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST THE VISITS OF MANY PEOPLE.  JUST
RECENTLY A GROUP OF LAWYERS FROM SPAIN CAME IN AND ANALYZED THE CASE,
AND WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE CASE,
ACCORDING, OBVIOUSLY, TO SALVADORAN LAW.  [CONTINUED]
