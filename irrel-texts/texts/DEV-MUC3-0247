   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 15 JUN 89 (RADIO SANDINO) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO] [TEXT] MR MINISTER
[HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER CARLOS LOPEZ CONTRERAS]: VARIOUS HONDURAN
PRESS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED ON THE 13 JUNE MEETING BETWEEN THE U.S.
VICE PRESIDENT AND LEADERS OF THE MERCENARY GROUPS, AMONG THEM ENRIQUE
BERMUDEZ, WHO HAVE BEEN USING HONDURAN TERRITORY AS A BASE AND
SANCTUARY FOR ITS CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST NICARAGUA.

   THESE MERCENARY GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR ATTACKS AGAINST NICARAGUA,
ADDING NEW VICTIMS TO THE THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS WHO HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED
THE EFFECTS OF U.S. AGGRESSION AND THE PARTICIPATION AND COMPLICITY OF YOUR
GOVERNMENT WITH THAT ILLEGAL POLICY.

   THE WELL-KNOWN U.S. POLICY OF MAINTAINING CONTRA FORCES IN HONDURAN
TERRITORY AND ITS CONSTANT CRIMINAL ATTACKS AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN
POPULATION -- WHICH HAVE LEFT 163 CIVILIAN VICTIMS SINCE THE COSTA DEL SOL
SUMMIT ON 31 MAY -- CHARACTERIZES THE TALKS BETWEEN U.S. GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS AND CONTRA LEADERS, AS WELL AS THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES IN THE LOSS
OF HUMAN LIVES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE IN MY COUNTRY.

   WHILE VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE WAS MEETING WITH THE MERCENARIES, PASTORAL
REPRESENTATIVES IN WASLALA AND LAS MINAS INFORMED THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY OF THE HUNDREDS OF PEASANTS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED, KIDNAPPED, AND
TORTURED BY THE MERCENARY GROUPS THAT INFILTRATE NICARAGUA FROM HONDURAS.  

   AT THE SAME TIME, THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED ON THE CONTINUATION OF
ATTACKS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES, AMONG THEM ONE IN SAN JOSE,
TIJUANA, SOUTHEAST OF ASTURIAS, JINOTEGA DEPARTMENT, WHERE FOUR PEASANTS
WERE KILLED ON 10 JUNE.  

   IN THE COSTA DEL SOL DECLARATION, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO CARRYING OUT THE DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND
RELOCATION OF THE MERCENARY GROUPS CURRENTLY BASED IN YOUR COUNTRY.
HOWEVER, YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED -- AGAINST THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS
OF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE -- THE OPTION SET FORTH BY A U.S. BIPARTISAN
AGREEMENT AIMED AT MAINTAINING THE CONTRAS IN HONDURAN TERRITORY.  

   INTERVIEWS WITH HONDURAN POLITICAL LEADERS, SUCH AS THE ONE PUBLISHED IN
THE DAILY LA TRIBUNA IN ITS 13 JUNE EDITION, CLEARLY STATE THAT THE U.S.
VICE PRESIDENT DID NOT GO TO HONDURAS TO SOLVE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, BUT TO
OBTAIN A CONFIRMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL NOT EXPEL THE CONTRAS
FROM HONDURAN TERRITORY.

   IN CONSENTING TO THE CONTINUED PRESENCE IN ITS TERRITORY OF MERCENARY
FORCES -- WHICH WERE CREATED TO ATTACK MY COUNTRY -- THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT
IS NOT ONLY HELPING TO BRING MORE SUFFERING AND DESTRUCTION TO THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE AND NATION, BUT IS ALSO CONTINUING THE HEAVY BURDEN ON THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN THE VICTIMS OF CRIMINAL AND TERRORIST
ACTIONS.  

   WITH THIS BEHAVIOR, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN EVINCES ITS TOTAL
 NONCOMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO EXPRESSED IN
THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS, TO NOT PERMIT THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO ATTACK
OTHER STATES AND TO DISCONTINUE ITS SUPPORT FOR IRREGULAR FORCES.

   THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT STRONGLY PROTESTS THE FACT THAT YOUR COUNTRY
CONTINUES TO ALLOW THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO CONDUCT ILLEGAL POLICIES THAT
GO AGAINST THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS AND THE PEACE EFFORTS AND THAT VIOLATE
THE PRINCIPLES AND NORMS ESTABLISHED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW TO GUARANTEE THE
PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE OF STATES.

   YOUR GOVERNMENT SHOULD REFLECT ON THIS AND HEED THE CALLS MADE BY THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES, WHO DEMAND AN END TO THE COUNTRY'S INVOLVEMENT
IN AN ILLEGAL AND ADVENTUROUS POLICY AND THAT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA
DEL SOL CALLING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A JOINT PLAN FOR THE
DEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND RELOCATION OF THE IRREGULAR FORCES BASED
IN YOUR COUNTRY BE HONORED.

   I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REITERATE MY ESTEEM TO YOUR EXCELLENCY.

   [SIGNED] MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BROCKMAN, FOREIGN MINISTER, REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA
