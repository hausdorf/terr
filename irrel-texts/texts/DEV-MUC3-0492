   DHAKA (BANGLADESH), 9 SEP 89 (THE BANGLADESH OBSERVER) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH HAS DECLARED HIS COUNTRY'S WAR AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKERS IN A DRAMATIC MANNER, COMMITTING A MASSIVE FUND OF $7.86
BILLION FOR THE PROGRAMME, PROVIDING INCREASED POWERS TO
LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND EVEN OFFERING SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA, FIGHTING
THIS MENACE.  TO DEAL WITH WHAT HE CALLED, "AMERICA'S TOUGHEST
DOMESTIC TEST IN DECADES" DURING HIS STERN ADDRESS ON TUESDAY, THE US
LEADER HAS GIVEN A NEW BOOST TO THE CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL CRUSADE
AGAINST NARCOTICS.

   THIS NEW INITIATIVE WILL BE WARMLY WELCOMED BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY,
MOST OF ALL BY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY COLOMBIA WHICH IS
FIGHTING A DESPERATE BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE BARONS.  THE NEWS FROM
BOGOTA IS SIMPLY FRIGHTENING.  IN THE COUNTRY'S LONG WAR AGAINST DRUG
DEALERS, NOTHING LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW -- THE MERCILESS KILLING
OF SECURITY OFFICERS AND THEIR RELATIVES -- HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
SHOULD COLOMBIA LOSE THIS WAR AGAINST COCAINE BARONS, DRUG LORDS IN
OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL FLEX THEIR MUSCLES TOO.  TO PUT IT
PLAINLY, COLOMBIA CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS WAR.  BUT WHETHER SHE
WINS OR LOSSES THIS BATTLE DEPENDS ON WHAT ASSISTANCE THE UNITED
STATES CAN PROVIDE TO THIS LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   HERE, COLOMBIA FACES DIFFICULT OPTIONS.  WHILE SHE HAS ACCEPTED
SOME LOGISTIC SUPPORT, SUCH AS HELICOPTERS, FROM WASHINGTON, SHE
MAINTAINS HERE OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF US TROOPS IN TACKLING WHAT SHE
RIGHTLY REGARDS AS A DOMESTIC CRISIS.  THE STATEMENT BY MR BUSH ON
WEDNESDAY HAS SO FAR MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS OPPOSITION.  THE
PROBLEM FACING BOGOTA IS, WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE LOGISTIC SUPPORT
FROM US WOULD HELP, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT OVERNIGHT RAISE THE STRENGTH
OF ITS ANI-NARCOTIC SECURITY FORCES.  WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
OFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, BOGOTA CAN, OF COURSE, BUY ARMS FOR USE
AGAINST DRUG BARONS.  BUT THE BATTLE WILL STILL BE HARD AND LONG.

   IN FIGHTING THIS RELENTLESS BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE DEALERS,
COLOMBIA HAS MADE ONE PERFECTLY VALID POINT, MORE THAN ONCE.  TRUE, IT
IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA TO WIN ITS
INTERNAL WAR, WITH ALL THE HELP THAT WASHINGTON CAN PROVIDE.  BUT THE
REAL BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS MUST BE FOUGHT WITHIN THE UNITED
STATES, ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, CHICAGO AND ALL OTHER
CITIES.  THIS IS THE MARKET FOR THE COCAINE BARONS OF COLOMBIA OR FOR
THE DRUGS PRODUCED IN THE INFAMOUS GOLDEN TRIANGLE IN ASIA.  AND IT IS
ALSO WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WHERE ALL THE CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION,
SOME CONTROLLED BY US CITIZENS, THRIVE UNDER THE EYES OF THE US LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MAY ASK IF ENOUGH
HAS BEEN DONE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AT THE US END.

   THIS STATEMENT BY MR BUSH SUGGESTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS
RECOGNISED THIS BASIC PROBLEM AND WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  A
MAJOR PORTION OF THE FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE ANTI-DRUG WAR WILL BE
USED IN STRENGTHENING THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE UNITED
STATES.  BUT QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE US CONGRESS
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH IN THAT DIRECTION.  IN FACT,
THERE IS SOME DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN HAS NOT BEEN
"BOLD ENOUGH" EITHER.  WHILE ONE MUST ADMIT THAT THE US CONGRESSMEN
ARE USED TO MAKING SUCH CRITICISMS AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION ON
PROBLEM ON WHICH THEY THEMSELVES RARELY OFFER ANY NEW INITIATIVE, ONE
HOPES THAT THE US ADMINISTRATION WILL KEEP ITS NEWLY-UNVEILED
ANTI-DRUG PLAN UNDER CONSTANT SCRUTINY AND ENSURE THAT THE BATTLE THAT
COLOMBIA IS BEING URGED TO WIN AT ALL COSTS IS NOT LOST WITHIN THE
UNITED STATES.
