   TEGUCIGALPA, 6 FEB 90 (CNA) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS
ROMERO SAID TUESDAY HONDURAS IS FACING AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SITUATION
AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CAN HELP A GREAT DEAL IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS
CONFRONTING HIS COUNTRY.

   CALLEJAS, INAUGURATED ON JAN. 27, TOLD THE CNA HONDURAS IS FACING A
CRISIS WHICH HIS NEW ADMINISTRATION, WITH HELP AND SUPPORT FROM THE
REPUBLIC OF CHINA, WILL BE ABLE TO TIDE OVER.

   HONDURAS LACKS FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO BUY OIL, MEDICINE AND FOOD FROM
ABROAD.  TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBTS TOTAL WELL OVER U.S.  DLRS
[DOLLARS] 200 MILLION.  "WE ARE FACING A STEEP SHORTAGE OF BASIC
FOODS, CORN IN PARTICULAR," CALLEJAS SAID.

   A POTENTIALLY RICH COUNTRY, HONDURAS CAN OVERCOME ALL ITS DIFFICULT
PROBLEMS AND ACHIEVE PROSPERITY IN THE LONG RUN, BUT IT NEEDS A SHOT
IN THE ARM, CALLEJAS SAID.

   THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA, CALLEJAS APPEALED, CAN EXTEND "SHORT-TERM
BRIDGE LOANS" TO HONDURAS TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF ACUTE SHORTAGE
IN FOOD AND OTHER NECESSITIES.  "A SHORT-TERM CREDIT OF DLRS 5
MILLION, FOR INSTANCE, CAN HELP US MAKE UP FOR THE SHORTAGE AND THEN
WE CAN MOVE AHEAD," CALLEJAS SAID.

   "THE SITUATION IS A CRITICAL ONE," CALLEJAS SAID, "BUT WE WILL BE
ABLE TO COPE WITH IT AND SURGE AHEAD FOR GREATER PROSPERITY, AND WHAT
WE NOW NEED IS A SHORT-TERM HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS IN THE REPUBLIC OF
CHINA."

   HE SAID THE PEOPLE OF HONDURAS HAVE YET TO SENSE THE CRISIS THEY
ARE FACING NOW.  THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, IN PARTICULAR, IS COMPARABLE TO
THE ONE THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA FACED IN AND SHORTLY AFTER 1950.

   "MY ADMINISTRATION KNOWS WHAT SHALL BE DONE," CALLEJAS SAID.  HE
WILL LET THE PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CRISIS AND CULTIVATE A SENSE
OF CRISIS THAT IS NEEDED TO RALLY THEMSELVES BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT TO
MOVE FORWARD.

   THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAVE SET A "GOOD EXAMPLE" FOR
OTHER NATIONS IN CRISIS TO FOLLOW, CALLEJAS SAID.  "OVER THE PAST 40
YEARS," HE POINTED OUT, "YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED WHAT CAN BE DONE TO
OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES AND ACHIEVE PROSPERITY."

   ASIDE FROM THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT, THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CAN SEND A
HIGH-LEVEL MISSION TO ADVISE HONDURAS ON HOW TO SOLVE ITS LONG-TERM
FINANCIAL PROBLEM, CALLEJAS SAID.  "YOUR COUNTRY HAS EXPERIENCE IN
THIS FIELD," HE ADDED, "AND WE HOPE WE WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR
EXPERIENCE."

   ANOTHER FIELD OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS TRADE AND
INVESTMENT, CALLEJAS SAID.  HONDURAS IS SETTING UP AN INDUSTRIAL PARK,
AND INVESTMENT FROM THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS MORE THAN WELCOME, HE
ADDED.

   THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS OPENING ITS MARKET TO FOREIGN IMPORTS, AND
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TAIWAN'S TOBACCO MARKET, IF HONDURAS CAN EARN
IT, "WILL HELP A GREAT DEAL AND START A CHAIN ACTION OF DEVELOPMENT,"
CALLEJAS SAID.  THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GENERATED FROM THE SALES OF
TOBACCO CAN BE USED TO PAY BACK SOME OF TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBT.
THE REPAYMENT WILL EARN MORE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT, WHICH IN TURN
SUPPORTS OTHER PROJECTS OF DEVELOPMENT.

   THE PRESENCE OF A U.N. MILITARY OBSERVER GROUP IN HONDURAS,
CALLEJAS SAID, WILL HELP STABILIZE THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
THE MISSION IS TO HELP EASE THE TENSION ALONG THE BORDERS OF EL
SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED BY GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES.

   CALLEJAS HAS VISITED THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA TWICE BEFORE.  HE TOURED
THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA AS MINISTER OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN 1968 AND
AGAIN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL PARTY IN 1988.

   ASKED IF HE WOULD ATTEND THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION IN TAIPEI ON
MAY 20, CALLEJAS SAID HE WOULD "TRY MY BEST TO GO (TO TAIPEI) MYSELF."
IF HE IS UNABLE TO ATTEND, HE ADDED, HE WILL SEND HIS PRESIDENT OF THE
NATIONAL CONGRESS, RODOLFO IRIAS NAVAS.

   "IF I CANNOT VISIT THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN MAY," CALLEJAS SAID, "I
WILL MAKE A VISIT TO YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR."  MOST
LIKELY, HE ADDED, HE WILL PAY A STATE VISIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA
IN NOVEMBER.

   IN RETURN, CALLEJAS SAID, "WE WILL BE HONORED TO HAVE YOUR
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT LI, VISIT US."

   RELATIONS BETWEEN HONDURAS AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ARE "EXTREMELY
CLOSE ONES," CALLEJAS SAID.  "AND WE IN HONDURAS HOPE TO FURTHER
CEMENT THOSE EXTREMELY GOOD RELATIONS," HE POINTED OUT.

   SUCH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE MONOPOLIZED BY THE
GOVERNMENTS, CALLEJAS SAID.  "WE NEED MORE CONTACT AMONG THE PEOPLE IN
ALL WALKS OF LIFE, ON CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL LEVELS, SO THAT
WE MAY CONTINUE IMPROVING THE EXTREMELY GOOD RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS
EXISTED BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES," HE POINTED OUT.
