   SAN SALVADOR, 14 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] ATTENTION,
ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THIS IS CADENA NACIONAL, THE NETWORK OF
FREEDOM, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S NETWORK.  ATTENTION, SALVADORAN PEOPLE:

   THE TERRORIST HORDES OF THE FARBUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN) HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY OUR BRAVE ARMED FORCES, WHO HAVE
GONE OUT TO DEFEND OUR SOVEREIGNTY, INTEGRITY, AND THE LIVES AND
PROPERTIES OF ALL SALVADORANS.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING THEIR ARMED FORCES AND
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI.

   AT THIS TIME, THE FMLN CRIMINALS ARE RECEIVING THE PUNISHEMENT THEY
DESERVE THROUGH THE GLORIOUS WEAPONS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.

   THE COWARDLY FMLN TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN HIDING SINCE 11
NOVEMBER IN THE HOMES OF DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS.  THEY ARE COWARDS.
THEY ARE LIKE THOSE COWARD CRIMINALS WHO AFTER COMMITTING MURDER RUN
TO HIDE BEHIND A WOMAN'S SKIRT.  THAT IS WHAT THOSE TERRORISTS ARE
DOING.  THEY ARE HIDING UNDER THE BEDS OF THE POPULATION, WHICH IS
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE TERRORISTS' ATTACKS.  THEY ARE COWARDS WHO
HAVE TREACHEROUSLY ATTACKED AND BOMBED THE PEOPLE.

   A FEW HOURS AGO, THE LIAR TERRORIST JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, FROM HIS
HOTEL ROOM IN MANAGUA -- WHERE HE HAS AIR CONDITIONING AND LOTS OF
FOOD -- SAID THAT THE FMLN HAS SEIZED POSITIONS, WHICH IS NOT TRUE.
ALL TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY ARE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL CONTROL
AND UNDER THE ARMED FORCES' MILITARY CONTROL.

   WE MUST INFORM YOU THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW AREAS WHERE TERRORISTS
HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN HOUSES AND ARE ACTING AS SNIPERS.  HOWEVER, THE
ARMED FORCES ARE TRYING TO DISLODGE THEM IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER IN
ORDER NOT TO HARM CIVILIANS.

   THE COWARDS ARE HIDING IN A FEW AREAS.  WE MUST TELL YOU THAT THE
AREAS WHERE THERE IS SOME RESISTANCE ARE ILOPANGO, COLONIA SANTA
LUCIA, SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, ZACAMIL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CIUDAD
DELGADO.

   SALVADORANS WHO ARE IN THOSE AREAS, VICTIMS OF THE TERRORISTS: FROM
HERE YOUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS, YOUR BROTHERS IN THE ARMED FORCES, TELL
YOU THAT WE ARE AT YOUR SIDE AT THIS TIME OF STRUGGLE, DURING THIS SAD
TIME WHEN YOU ARE FACED WITH HUNGER AND DEATH THREATS BY THE FMLN
TERRORIST HORDES.  WE ARE AT YOUR SIDE, COMPATRIOT!  WE ARE WITH YOU
SALVADORAN PEOPLE!  YOUR ARMED FORCES WILL NOT ABANDON YOU.  YOU CAN
BE SURE THAT ALL THIS WILL SOON BE OVER.  WE WILL SOON DISLODGE THESE
MANGY DOGS WHO HAVE COME WITH [NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL]
ORTEGA'S WEAPONS AND TERRORIST HORDES, WHO HAVE COME HERE TO MASSACRE
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE ARE WITH YOU COMPATRIOT!  STAY WHERE YOU
ARE.  REMAIN CALM, AS YOU WILL SOON BE FREED FROM THE TERRORIST
HORDES.

   ILOPANGO, COLONIA SANTA LUCIA, SOYAPANGO, MEJICANOS, ZACAMIL,
AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AND CIUDAD DELGADO: REMEMBER THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND
CRISTIANI ARE AT THE HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT YOUR ARMED
FORCES ARE UNITEDLY, PROFESSIONALLY, AND PATRIOTICALLY STRUGGLING TO
DEFEND YOU FROM THIS BRUTAL AND BESTIAL ATTACK THAT WE DENOUNCE BEFORE
THE WORLD.

   WHY IS IT THAT NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING?  WHY DO JOURNALISTS IN EUROPE
SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING?  WHY DO THEY NOT TELL THE TRUTH?
THEY ONLY REPEAT THE LIES OF RADIO VENCEREMOS AND THE LIAR RADIO
FARABUNDO MARTI.  THE PEOPLE'S TRUTH IS HERE.  HERE IS THE TRUTH OF
OUR PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ENDURED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS FOR 10 YEARS!

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: BE BRAVE AND UNITED, FULL OF PATRIOTISM, AND
SURE OF OUR VICTORY.  OUR FATHERLAND IS FREE!  OUR ARMED FORCES ARE
GLORIOUSLY FIGHTING!  FORWARD, ARMED FORCES!  FORWARD, SALVADORAN
PEOPLE!
