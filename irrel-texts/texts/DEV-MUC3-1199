DEV-MUC3-1199 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   NO CITY, NO DATE (FBIS) -- [TEXT] BOGOTA DOMESTIC SERVICE IN SPANISH AT
0230 GMT BEGINS TO BROADCAST LIVE OR RECORDED A SPEECH BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS FROM THE NARINO PALACE IN BOGOTA.  RECEPTION IS FAIR TO POOR.

   BARCO BEGINS HIS ADDRESS BY EXPRESSING HIS CONCERN OVER THE
DISNFORMATION CAMPAIGN SURROUNDING THE RECENT EVENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN
PLACE.  HE GOES ON TO CITE THE VARIOUS ITEMS BEING PUBLISHED BY THE
COUNTRY'S MEDIA CONCERNING SECRET DEALINGS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS, A
RELAXATION OF ACTIONS AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND OTHER STORIES
WHICH HE INSISTS ARE NOT TRUE.

   HE BLAMES NARCOTERRORISM FOR THE VIOLENCE AND CONFUSION WARNS THAT
SOME PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT.  BARCO NOTES THAT
THE GOVERNMENT RESPECTS THE MEDIA AND SUGGESTS THAT PUBLIC OPINION IS
BEING MANIPULATED.  HE THEN TOUCHES ON THE CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE
KIDNAPPING OF THE SON OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY.
BARCO SAYS: "THE GOVERNMENT, IN THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPING OF DR.
MONTOYA'S SON, AS ON OTHER UNFORTUNATE OCCASIONS, INCLUDING THE CASES
OF DR. ANDRES PASTRANA AND DR. ALVARO GOMEZ, AND EVEN CASES IN WHICH
MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN KDNAPPED BY SUBVERSIVES, HAS
CONSIDERED AS APPROPRIATE AND VALUABLE THE EFFORTS MADE BY THOSE WHO
PERFORMED HUMANITARIAN DUTIES AND SHOWED GOOD WILL FOR THEIR RELEASE."
HE ADDS THAT NEITHER THE SECURITY COUNCIL NOR THE PRESIDENT CAN BE
PREVENTED FROM ASCERTAINING INFORMATION WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE
RELEASE OF HOSTAGES.

   BARCO SAYS THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST NARCOTERRORISM HAS NOT BEEN
EASY. HE ADDS THAT KEEPING THE HOPES OF THE NATION ALIVE, RATHER THAN
ENHANCING THE COUNTRY'S IMAGE, IS THE GOAL.  HE ADDS THAT THE COUNTRY
WILL NOT SURVIVE WITH ITS PROBLEMS, NOTING HIS UPCOMING EUROPEAN TRIP
TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE DANGERS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO REAFFIRM
THE COUNTRY'S GOOD NAME.

   IN ENDING HIS ADDRESS, BARCO URGES CALM AND WARNS AGAINST DIVISION,
ADDING THAT THIS IS THE GOAL OF THE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND.  HE
URGES EVERYONE TO DEFEND THEIR DEMOCRACY.

   BARCO ENDS HIS ADDRESS AT 0250 GMT.

   FURTHER AS WARRANTED.
