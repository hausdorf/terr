   LHASA (TIBET), 7 MAY 90 (LHASA TIBET TELEVISION NETWORK) -- [TEXT]
ECUADORAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER CORDOVEZ, MADAME CORDOVEZ, AND FOUR
OTHER ECUADORAN OFFICIALS ARRIVED IN LLASA ON THE MORNING OF 5 MAY.

   AT 1830 THE SAME DAY, PUQUANG, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE TIBET
AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT, MET WITH THE ECUADORAN
VISITORS AT THE TIBETAN-STYLE MEETING ROOM AT THE HOLIDAY INN IN
LHASA.  IN A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG BRIEFED
FOREIGN MINISTER CORDOVEZ ON TIBET'S AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY,
INDUSTRY, ENERGY, AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND ESPECIALLY THE SUCCESSES
TIBET HAS ACHIEVED IN VARIOUS FIELDS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
CENTRAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT SINCE TIBET'S DEMOCRATIC REFORM.

   ON BEHALF OF THE TIBETAN AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT,
VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG PRESENTED GIFTS TO THE VISITORS.  THEN, VICE
CHAIRMAN PUQUANG HOSTED A DINNER IN HONOR OF THE ECUADORAN VISITORS.

   MAKING HIS WELCOMING SPEECH, VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG SAID: YOUR
EXCELLENCY MINISTER CORDOVEZ HAS VISITED CHINA MANY TIMES AND YOU HAVE
CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRIENDLY RELATIONS
BETWEEN CHINA AND ECUADOR AND THE PEOPLES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES.  YOUR
EXCELLENCY'S CURRENT VISIT TO TIBET WILL CERTAINLY ENABLE YOU TO
UNDERSTAND CHINA BETTER.

   VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG STRESSED: TIBET HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHINA'S
SACRED TERRITORY SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE 13TH CENTURY.  IT IS A FACT
ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE WHOLE WORLD THAT ALL PREVIOUS CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS
EFFECTIVELY EXERCISED THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IN TIBET.

   VICE CHAIRMAN PUQUANG ALSO SAID THAT, SINCE THE LIFTING THE MARTIAL
LAW ORDER IN LHASA, TIBET'S SITUATION HAS BEEN STABLE, ITS PUBLIC
ORDER HAS BEEN NORMAL, ITS ECONOMY HAS BEEN DEVELOPING STEADILY, AND
THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN LIVING AND WORKING IN PEACE AND CONTENTMENT.

   MAKING HIS EXTEMPORANTEOUSLY SPEECH AT THE DINNER, FOREIGN AFFAIRS
MINISTER CORDOVEZ SAID: VISITING THE TIBETAN AUTONOMOUS REGION HAS
BEEN MY DREAM FOR MANY YEARS.  LIKE TIBET, ECUADOR IS A COUNTRY ON A
PLATEAU.  WHEN I SET FOOT IN BEAUTIFUL LHASA, I HAD THE FEELING THAT I
HAD RETURNED TO MY HOMETOWN.

   MINISTER CORDOVEZ WHOLEHEARTEDLY WISHED TIBET PROSPERITY IN ALL
FIELDS AND THE TIBETAN PEOPLE HAPPINESS.
