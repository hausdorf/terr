IN ADDITION TO THE CHURCH, OFFICES OF CREDHO ALSO OPERATED THERE --
CREDHO IS AN AFFILIATE OF AN ORGANIZATION THEY CALL DIACOMIAS; THAT
60 PERSONS ARE EMPLOYED THERE; THAT MOST OF THOSE PERSONS ARE NOT
PARISHIONERS, BUT CREDHO EMPLOYEES; THAT CREDHO'S DIRECTOR IS A PRIEST

   SERRANO SAID HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF CREDHO AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
AFOREMENTIONED CHURCH.  HE ASSERTED THAT HE LEARNED ON 29 OCTOBER THAT
IN THE CHURCHYARD TWO TRUCKS WERE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES, WHICH WERE
HURLED THE NEXT DAY AT THE MILITARY COMPLEX OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT
CHIEFS OF STAFF.  HE DECIDED TO REMAIN SILENT ABOUT THIS, THEREBY
COVERING FOR THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO MURDER HUMBLE WORKING PEOPLE.
SERRANO ALSO SAID THAT CREDHO IS FINANCED BY A FRONT GROUP CALLED
DIACOMIAS, WHICH HAS NO LEGAL STATUS, BUT IS THE CHANNEL FOR AID
THAT IS SENT IN CASH BY SO-CALLED SOLIDARITY CHURCHES AND ASSOCIATIONS
ORGANIZED IN SWEDEN, BRITAIN, NETHERLANDS, CANADA, THE UNITED STATES,
AND AUSTRALIA.  THIS MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED TO LUTHERAN, CATHOLIC,
EMANUEL BAPTIST, AND EPISCOPAL CHURCHES, AS WELL AS TO THE FOUNDATION
FOR PROMOTION OF COOPERATIVES [FUNDACION PROMOTORA DE COOPERATIVAS,
FUNPROCOOP] AND THE FEDERATION OF COOPERATIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT

GROUPS COMPRISE DIACOMIAS AND TWICE A MONTH, ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM
EACH GROUP MEETS AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO DISCUSS DISTRIBUTION OF
THESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MOST OF WHICH, HE SAID, IS DELIVERED TO
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE ORGANIZED THAT ARE DIRECTED BY THE
