   SAN SALVADOR, 8 MAY 90 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS WARNED TODAY THAT THE POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF GENERAL
HUMBERTO LARIOS BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CURRENT CHIEF OF STAFF
OF THE ARMED FORCES, "WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS"
WITH THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH WILL BE RESUMED THIS COMING 16 MAY IN
VENEZUELA.

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) RELEASED A
COMMUNIQUE HERE TODAY ON THE CHANGE IN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY
LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE RETIREMENT OF DEPUTY DEFENSE
MINISTER COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA.

   "THESE CHANGES WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE CONCERTED CEASE-FIRE
PROCESS, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENTS BASED ON DEMOCRATIZATION
WHILE IMPUNITY PREVAILS IN THE ARMY AND IT IS NOT SUBJECTED TO A
THOROUGH PURGE," THE FMLN ADDED.

   GEN LARIOS TOLD NEWSMEN YESTERDAY ABOUT HIS POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT BY
COL EMILIO PONCE IN THE DEFENSE MINISTRY IS A CHANGE WHICH HE REGARDED
AS "NATURAL."

   "EVENTUALLY THERE MAY BE A CHANGE OF THAT SORT.  IT IS A NATURAL
AND ROUTINE CHANGE," THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID WHEN ASKED ABOUT
PERSISTENT RUMORS TO THIS EFFECT IN THAT PAST FEW DAYS IN EL SALVADOR.

   COL PONCE, A MEMBER OF THE 1966 GRADUATION CLASS KNOWN AS "LA
TANDONA," CURRENTLY HAS GREAT INFLUENCE AMONG THE ARMED FORCES
OFFICERS. HE HAS HELD THE POST OF CHIEF OF STAFF SINCE THE MIDDLE OF
LAST YEAR.

   THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE STATED THAT PONCE'S REMOVAL FROM THE POST OF
CHIEF OF STATE "WOULD BREAK THE CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HIGH
COMMAND IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS."  THE JESUIT
PRIESTS WERE ASSASSINATED ON 16 NOVEMBER BY ALLEGED ARMED FORCES
MEMBERS, WHO WERE TURNED OVER TO JUDICIARY AUTHORITIES.
