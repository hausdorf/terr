DEV-MUC3-1094 (UNISYS)

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 5 FEB 90 (LA PRENSA) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT]
DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS, THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR CONTINUISM,
DANIEL ORTEGA, HAS BEEN INSISTING ON HIS INTENTION OF A QUICK
RECONCILIATION WITH THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SAYS SO
AMID SLANDER AND THREATS THAT INVALIDATE THE SINCERITY OF HIS REMARKS.

   FOR ORTEGA AND HIS SPOKESMEN, TO BE RESPECTED BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AND TO MANAGE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES IS NOW
HIS PARTY'S "BEST GUARANTEE," THAT PARTY'S GREAT ELECTORAL OFFER.  THE
ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THIS INCOHERENT AND CONTRADICTORY
ATTITUDE IS AS A REELECTION STRATEGY, REALIZING THE POPULARITY OF THE
IDEA OF NORMALIZING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
ORTEGA HAS NOT WANTED TO REMAIN DISTANCED FROM THAT ASPIRATION, WHICH
THE PEOPLE JUDGE AS INDISPENSABLE TO IMPROVE THE CRISIS THEY ARE IN.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT ANY UNNECESSARY DISTANCING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE SANDINISTS WAS DUE TO THE LATTER'S
INITIATIVE.

   EVERYONE KNOWS THE EFFORTS MADE BY BOTH MR BOWDLER AS WELL AS
LAWRENCE PEZULLO TO ATTAIN CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH THE SANDINIST
GOVERNMENT THAT FOLLOWED SOMOZA DEBAYLE'S.  THE STRONG PRESSURES ON
THE DICTATOR TO RESIGN WERE DECISIVE IN HIS DEPARTURE.  THE CARTER
GOVERNMENT'S MASSIVE AND EARLY AID WAS DECISIVE IN STABILIZING THE
REVOLUTIONARY REGIME.

   THE FSLN [SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] NATIONAL
DIRECTORATE, HOWEVER, HAD OTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM HAVANA.  AS SOON AS
THEY GOT OUT OF THE AIRPLANE, THEY TOOK IT OUT ON THE "YANKEES, ENEMY
OF HUMANITY," WHICH WERE ONLY SEEKING AN UNPREJUDICED RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE NEW LEADERS.  THAT RHETORIC WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS OBVIOUS IF
IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT THE TRUE PURPOSE OF THAT CONFRONTATION CAMPAIGN
WAS TO JUSTIFY ITS MISSION OF SETTING CENTRAL AMERICA ON FIRE AND THUS
DISTRACTING THE UNITED STATES WITH A STRATEGY OF DESTABILIZING THE
AREA, WHICH IS CONVENIENT TO USSR INTERESTS.

   THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] GENERAL
STAFF MOVED TO NIACARAGUA, AND THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATION
VENCEREMOS BEGAN BROADCASTING FROM MANAGUA WHILE THE WHOLE COUNTRY
BECAME A SANCTUARY FOR SALVADORAN TERRORISTS AND A LOGISTICS RESUPPLY
BASE.

   THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION MADE ONE LAST EFFORT AT MANZANILLO, BUT
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER TINOCO ONLY WENT TO READ A PREPARED TEXT,
USING THAT BRILLIANT OPPORTUNITY AS A CENTER STAGE FOR PROPAGANDA AND
DISTURBANCE.

   MENAWHILE, THE SLOGAN "IF NICARAGUA WON, SO WILL EL SALVADOR,"
FLOODED RADIO STATIONS, BANNERS, WATCHWORDS, GRAFFITI, AND BOASTFUL
SPEECHES, WHILE THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO
OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUATEMALAN REVOLUTIONARY BANDS DID
LIKEWISE, DEVASTATING EL PETEN.

   DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE ENDERS CAME HIMSELF TO HOLD TALKS WITH
THE FSLN'S GENERAL DIRECTORATE, PROPOSING AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD
GUARANTEE STABILITY IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR MESSIAH-LIKE PROJECT OF
SUBVERTING THE REGION.

   WHEN THESE TALKS FAILED, WHAT FOLLOWED WAS INEVITABLE AND IS
REGRETTABLE.

   NOW, EVEN THOUGH THE SANDINISTS MAY TRY AFTER 10 YEARS TO MAKE UP
FOR LOST TIME, TRYING TO PUT THINGS RIGHT, THE RECIPE CONTINUES TO BE
THE SAME: ONE, "GENUINELY FREE AND JUST" ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, AND
TWO, THE REMOVAL OF THEIR INCITING HANDS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.  ON
THESE LINES, SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER'S DECLARATION LAST WEEK
WAS CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL: CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE ELECTIONS WERE
HONEST, "SOMETHING VERY HARD TO DETERMINE, UNLESS ORTEGA ALLOWS
CONGRESSINAL OBSERVERS," AND CONVICING PROOF THAT NICARAGUA HAS
STOPPED SENDING ARMS TO EL SALVADOR.  IF THE ELECTIONS ARE FRAUDULENT,
SENTENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED: "THE UNITED STATES COULD MAKE
NICARAGUA'S SITUATION TOUGHER."  IN OTHER WORDS, ORTEGA WOULD CONFIRM
HIMSELF ONLY AS A GUARANTOR OF WAR AND MISERY.
