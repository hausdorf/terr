   MEDELLIN, 30 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN DRUG MAFIAS
HAVE DENIED THAT THEY ARE PREPARING AN ATTACK ON THE LIFE OF U.S.
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, WHO WILL VISIT THIS CARIBBEAN COLONIAL BEACH
RESORT ON 15 FEBRUARY FOR AN ANTI-DRUG SUMMIT MEETING.

   BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO, PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, AND U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH
WILL SIGN A MANIFESTO IN CARTAGENA THAT WAS DESIGNED IN SANTA CRUZ DE
LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA.  THE DOCUMENT WILL OUTLINE STRATEGIES THAT THEY
WILL ADOPT TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THE MYSTERIOUS CLANDESTINE GROUP THE "EXTRADITABLES," -- THE ARMED
BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DRUG TRAFFICKERS -- SAID IN A BULLETIN
RELEASED EARLY THIS MORNING THAT THE REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE ATTACK ON
BUSH IN CARTAGENA ARE FALSE.

   "THESE REPORTS ARE PART OF A PLAN TO UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF
ALL OUR PEACE PROPOSALS," THE DOCUMENT SAID.  IN THE DOCUMENT, THE
"EXTRADITABLES" ALSO [WORDS INDISTINCT].

   LAST WEEKEND, THE U.S. CBS TELEVISION NETWORK REPORTED THE
POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK WITH ROCKETS AND MISSILES BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS
ON BUSH'S PLANE IN CARTAGENA.

   IN A STATEMENT BY FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LONDONO, THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF TERRORIST PLANS AGAINST
THE U.S. PRESIDENT, AND ADDED THAT U.S. AND COLOMBIAN SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS WERE CAPABLE OF GUARANTEEING THE SAFETY OF THE FOUR
PRESIDENTS.

   THE EXTRADITABLES, A MAFIA GROUP BASED IN MEDELLIN, IN NORTHWEST
COLOMBIAN, HAS BEEN INSISTING SINCE 17 JANUARY THAT THEY WANT A PEACE
DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO,
WHO DECLARED WAR ON THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN AUGUST, 1989.  [CONTINUED]
