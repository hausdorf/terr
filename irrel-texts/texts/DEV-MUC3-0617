DEV-MUC3-0617 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   BUENOS AIRES, 30 OCT 89 (NA) -- [TEXT] ARGENTINE FOREIGN MINISTER
DOMINGO CAVALLO TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT HAS
ASKED THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT TO "INTERCEDE WITH THE OTHER CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND WITH ANYONE ELSE THAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCE OVER
THE CONTRAS" TO MAKE THEM DISBAND.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO ACCOMPANIED PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM TO
COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA, SAID THAT "IN ORDER TO MAKE THE NICARAGUAN
ELECTORAL PROCESS EASIER, MENEM HAS ANSWERED THAT HE WILL DO
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO HELP BRING PEACE TO THAT REGION."

   CAVALLO ADDED THAT IN VIEW OF THAT "I WILL BEGIN CONTACTS WITH
OTHER FOREIGN MINISTERS TO GET AN OBJECTIVE VIEW OF WHAT WE CAN DO."

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT DURING MENEM'S BRIEF MEETING
WITH DANIEL ORTEGA IN MANAGUA, THE ARGENTINE CHIEF EXECUTIVE RECEIVED
"INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE CONTRAS, DURING
WHICH 18 PEASANTS WERE KILLED RECENTLY."  HE ADDED THAT "UNFORTUNATELY
THE RESURGENCE OF HOSTILITIES COULD JEOPARDIZE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS"
THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION.

   ON 28 OCTOBER MENEM HAD EXPRESSED HIS DISAGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA'S
DECISION TO TERMINATE THE UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE. THIS DECISION HAD
PROMPTED AN INCIDENT INVOLVING U.S. PRESIDENT GEROGE BUSH, WHO ACCUSED
THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT OF BEHAVING "LIKE A WILD ANIMAL AT A PARTY."

   DURING HIS MEETING WITH MENEM, THE NICARAGUAN LEADER JUSTIFIED THE
DECISION BY LISTING THE VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT THE CONTRAS HAVE CARRIED
OUT AND EXPLAINED THAT FOR THE CEASEFIRE TO BE REINSTATED "THE CONTRAS
MUST DISBAND IN KEEPING WITH THE DECISION REACHED BY THE LATIN
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AT THE MEETING IN TELA (HONDURAS)."

   CAVALLO SAID THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE ARGENTINE MEMBERS
OF THE OAS OBSERVATION TEAM, SO FAR, "THE ELECTORAL MECHANISMS SET UP
FOR THE 25 FEBRUARY 1990 ELECTIONS ARE WORKING WELL," AND THAT THERE
IS "INTENSE" POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN NICARAGUA.

   ASKED WHETHER THE SANDINISTS RESPECT THE OPPOSITION, CAVALLO STATED
THAT VIOLETA CHAMORRO, DURING HER MEETING WITH MENEM IN COSTA RICA,
HAD STATED THAT "THE USE OF OFFICIAL NEWS MEDIA IS ALLOCATED
DISCRIMINATORILY, BUT IN GENERAL SHE EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH THE
CURRENT PROCESS AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ONES."
