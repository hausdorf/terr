   BUENOS AIRES, 9 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [EXCERPTS] THE MOTOR
TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION [UTA] BEGAN AN INDEFINITE STRIKE AT MIDNIGHT,
CONTRADICTING GOVERNMENT ORDERS WHICH STATED THAT THE UTA AND THE
ARGENTINE FEDERATION OF AUTOMOTIVE PASSENGER CARRIERS [FATAP] MUST
SOLVE THE SALARY PROBLEM THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.

   THE SITUATION ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE STOPPAGE IS SLIGHTLY BETTER,
ALTHOUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE STREETS
TRYING TO GET ON THE FEW BUSES BEING DRIVEN BY THEIR OWNERS.

   A FEW MINUTES AGO, DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR TRANSPORTATION NESTOR
FERNANDEZ ANNOUNCED THAT AT MIDDAY ONLY 30 PERCENT OF THE USUAL NUMBER
OF BUSES IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL WERE WORKING NORMALLY; BECAUSE OF
THIS, MEASURES WILL BE ADOPTED TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF
THE BUSES WILL RUN TODAY.

   REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FEDERAL POLICE, THE BUENOS AIRES PROVINCIAL
POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GENDERMERIE ARE MEETING AT TRANSPORTATION
SECRETARIAT OFFICES TO STUDY WAYS OF RESTORING NORMAL BUS SERVICE.

   SUBWAY CHAIRMAN JOSE BARBERO REPORTS THAT HIS SECTOR'S SERVICES
HAVE ALSO IMPROVED, AND FIVE SUBWAY LINES ARE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.
ALTHOUGH THE SUBWAY PERSONNEL ARE MEMBERS OF THE UTA, THEY HAVE
DECIDED TO SUSPEND THEIR STRIKE.

   THE RAILROAD SERVICE IS NORMAL.  MORE COACHES WILL BE PUT INTO
SERVICE, AND THE NUMBER OF TRAINS IN SERVICE WILL BE INCREASED, BUT
TRAINS OF THE ROCA LINE CONNECTING CONSTITUCION TO LA PLATA THROUGH
THE TEMPERLEY STRETCH ARE DELAYED BECAUSE OF A DERAILMENT.

   UTA SECRETARY GENERAL JUAN MANUEL PALACIOS HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE
INDEFINITE STRIKE WILL CONTINUE AND THAT THE UTA WILL NOT ACCEPT
COMPULSORY NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A LEGAL SOLUTION TO THE
CONFLICT.  HE SAYS THAT THIS WOULD MERELY PUT OFF THE PROBLEM FOR A
MONTH OR SO.  PALACIOS ADDED THAT IT WOULD ONLY CREATE MORE
DIFFICULTIES FOR THE WORKERS.

   FATAP DIRECTOR LUIS CARRAL ASSERTED THAT THE BUSINESS SECTOR WILL
DOUBLE ITS EFFORTS TO PUT THE BUSES BACK INTO SERVICE.  CARRAL SAID
THAT IN VIEW OF COMPULSORY NEGOTIATIONS FATAP WILL URGE WORKERS TO
RETURN TO THEIR JOBS UNLESS THEY WANT TO BE DISMISSED.

   TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BUSINESSMEN HAVE INFORMED THE TRANSPORTATION
SECRETARIAT THAT A FEW DRIVERS ARE RETURNING TO WORK.  BUSINESSMEN
BELIEVE THAT IN A FEW MORE HOURS 40-50 PERCENT OF THE BUSES WILL BE
FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.

   PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM COMMENTED THIS MORNING ON THE UTA ATTITUDE:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MENEM] THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  WE CANNOT
PAY MORE THAN WE HAVE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE BUSINESSMEN HAVE OFFERED A
BASIC SALARY OF AROUND 75,000 AUSTRALES PER MONTH.  UNTIL YESTERDAY
THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTED NEARLY $100, AND THIS IS A GOOD INCREASE.

   EVIDENTLY, THERE IS A POLITICAL INFILTRATION OF IDEAS THAT ARE NOT
SHARED BY ALL ARGENTINE PEOPLE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE INFILTRATION
COMES FROM PERONIST OR RADICAL MOVEMENTS.  THIS IS THE
 WORK OF THE ULTRA-LEFT.  [END RECORDING]

   MENEM ASSERTED THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK AND WHO ARE SACRIFICING
THEMSELVES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE REWARDED.  HE URGED
THEM NOT TO LEAVE THEIR POSTS.  MENEM ADDED THAT YESTERDAY MANY
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ASKED HIM NOT TO GIVE IN.  THE PRESIDENT SAID HE
HAS DECIDED NOT GIVE IN, NOT BECAUSE HE IS STUBBORN, BUT BECAUSE
PEOPLE WHO NEED THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SERVICES CANNOT BE DEFRAUDED.

   ASKED IF THE RAILROADS THAT JOIN THE STRIKE WILL BE CLOSED DOWN,
MENEM SAID:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MENEM] THE RAILROAD LINES THAT STRIKE WILL BE
CLOSED.

   [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] BUT MANY PEOPLE WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT
TRANSPORTATION.

   [MENEM] WE WILL FIND A WAY OF GETTING THESE PEOPLE TO THEIR JOBS.
WE CANNOT ACCEPT THIS TYPE OF ATTITUDE.  OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE
THE COUNTRY EXPLODE?  [END RECORDING]

   AT 1700 THIS AFTERNOON THE CABINET MEETING THAT STARTED LAST NIGHT
WILL BE RECONVENED.  THE CABINET MEMBERS ATTENDING THE MEETING WILL
ANALYZE THE DIFFICULTIES CREATED BY THE UTA DECISION TO CONTINUE THE
STRIKE.  THE MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] ROOM UNDER
THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF INTERIOR MINISTER EDUARDO BAUZA.  JUSTICIALIST
LEADER ANTONIO CAFFIERO WILL ATTEND THE MEETING.  PRES MENEM WILL NOT
ATTEND.

   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT 50 BUS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN URGED TO
RETURN TO NORMAL WORK; OTHERWISE DECREE 429, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE
TEMPORARY CONFISCATION OF BUSES, WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.  THIS DECREE,
WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY PRESIDENT MENEM, ESTABLISHES THAT BUSES
WILL BE CONFISCATED AND DRIVEN BY NATIONAL GENDARMERIE PERSONNEL.

   IN A JUSTICIALIST PARTY COMMUNIQUE SIGNED BY ANTONIO CAFFIERO, THE
PARTY EXPRESSES ITS SUPPORT FOR THE DECISIONS MADE BY PRESIDENT MENEM.

   COMMANDER ADALINO BARBERI, THE NATIONAL GENDARMERIE DIRECTOR
GENERAL, HAS REPORTED THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARIAT OFFICIALS
ARE STILL STUDYING THE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO CONFISCATE THE BUSES
FROM THE OWNERS WHO FAIL TO FOLLOW GOVERNMENT INSTRUCTIONS.
