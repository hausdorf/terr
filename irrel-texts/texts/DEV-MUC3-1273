   JERUSALEM (ISRAEL), 8 MAY 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] IN CHILE,
FOREIGN MINISTER ENRIQUE SILVA CIMMA HAS PROTESTED TO ISRAELI AMBASSADOR
DANIYEL MOQEDI OVER HIS STATEMENTS ON THE PLO.  SPEAKING AT LUNCHEON WITH
THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE PORT CITY OF VALPARAISO, MOQEDI CALLED THE
CHILEAN GOVERNMENT NAIVE FOR AGREEING TO RECEIVE AN OFFICIAL FROM THE PLO.
MOQEDI SAID CHILE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE CALLED THE REAL NATURE OF THIS
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

   CHILE'S FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR HAD GIVEN
ASSURANCES OF HIS DEEP RESPECT FOR THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT, AND
EXPLAINED HE MAY HAVE USED IMPROPER LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF HIS LESS THAN
FLUENT SPANISH.  HE SAID THE ISSUE WAS NOW RESOLVED.  THE PLO OFFICIAL
FARUQ QADDUMI VISITED CHILE LAST WEEK, AND MET WITH SEVERAL GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN.
