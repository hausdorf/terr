DEV-MUC3-1114 (UNISYS)

   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA
BY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] I
HAVE SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS OF MY POLITICAL LIFE SAYING THINGS
CLEARLY.  MANY PEOPLE DESCRIBE THAT ATTITUDE AS VEHEMENCE OR
RADICALISM.  I DISAGREE WITH THAT VIEW.

   WHEN THE UNITED STATES INVADED PANAMA -- AND I WAS AWARE OF WHAT
NORIEGA WAS -- I SAID THAT DESPITE THAT FACT, THE INVASION HAD BEEN A
CRIME.  WE DEMANDED THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS.  I
SAID THAT IF THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL DID NOT TAKE PLACE, I WOULD NOT
ATTEND THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT, BECAUSE I COULD NOT SIT AT THE SAME TABLE
WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT WHILE A LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY REMAINED
INVADED.  AND IT HAPPENED.  IT HAPPENED.  THE TROOPS HAD TO WITHDRAW.
AND WE HAVE HELD A CORDIAL MEETING FOR THAT REASON.

   [AMAT] MR PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE CONVINCED US [WORDS INDISTINCT]
THINGS THE WAY YOU SEE AND FEEL ABOUT THEM.  WILL YOU TELL US FRANKLY
-- FRANKLY -- WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE SUMMIT?  WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE SUMMIT?  WHAT IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS WERE REACHED AT THE SUMMIT?

   [GARCIA] FRANKLY, AND IN A NUTSHELL, IT WAS POSITIVE.  IT CREATED A
MULTILATERAL ATMOSPHERE, AND WE TALKED VERY CANDIDLY.  AS FOR ME
PERSONALLY, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET A CONTINENTAL POLITICIAN
LIKE BUSH, AND I FOUND HIM TO BE A PRAGMATIC PERSON.  I PROBABLY
DISAGREE WITH HIM ON MORE THAN HALF OF THE THINGS HE THINKS, BUT I DO
NOT THINK THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE OBLIGED TO BE IDENTICAL. WHAT IS
IMPORTANT IS TO LOOK AT EACH PERSON FOR HIS GOOD POINTS -- HOWEVER FEW
OR MANY THEY MAY BE -- TO ESTABLISH A RAPPORT ON THAT BASIS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS BEING PLANNED?  WHAT IS NEXT?  WHAT IS GOING TO
BE DONE TO CONTINUE... [CHANGES THOUGHT] IN ORDER FOR THE PRESIDENTS
TO KEEP IN CONSTANT TOUCH TO FULFILL WHAT THEY SIGNED?

   [GARCIA] WELL, THERE WILL BE CONSTANT COMMUNICATION.  IT IS EASY TO
TALK WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT, WHO IS NOT GOD.  THERE ARE TELEPHONES TO
DO THAT.  MR. BELL INVENTED A LITTLE GADGET OVER A CENTURY AGO CALLED
THE TELEPHONE AND WE, THE PRESIDENTS, COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER --
WITH BARCO, PAZ ZAMORA, AND PRESIDENT BUSH, TO ASK: WILL WE OR WILL WE
NOT DO WHAT WE PLEDGED TO DO?  IF WE DO NOT, AT LEAST IT WILL NOT BE
MY FAULT OR THAT OF THE LATIN AMERICANS.

   [AMAT] WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN COLOMBIA, AND
THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT IS ALSO FACING AN ELECTORAL PROCESS...

   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] AND YOU KNOW THE CANDIDATE, FORTUNATELY.
[CHUCKLES]

   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, IT LOOKS LIKE THE OPPOSITION IS GOING TO
DEFEAT YOU IN YOUR COUNTRY?

   [GARCIA] IT IS A POSSIBILITY, IT IS TRUE.

   [AMAT] WHY?

   [GARCIA] LOOK, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO YOUR QUESTION WOULD THINK THAT
FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN I ASSUMED POWER, PERU WAS A COUNTRY FULL OF GOLD,
VERY RICH, THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE THE SPANISH CONQUEST -- ORDERLY, AND
WITHOUT PROBLEMS.  FIVE YEARS AGO IT HAD A DEVELOPED TERRORIST
PROBLEM.  IT HAD A FOREIGN DEBT OF 14.5 BILLION AND WAS EXTREMELY
POOR.  FIVE YEARS HAVE ELAPSED.  I EXPLAINED TO YOU ONCE
 THAT I TRIED TO MAKE IT GROW AT GREAT SPEED AND MANAGED TO DO SO.
THEN WE FACED A DECLINE, AND WE ARE NOW STABILIZING THE SITUATION.

   HOWEVER, MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT A PERSON CAN SOLVE MANY THINGS
BECAUSE OF THE IMPETUOSITY IN HIS PERSONALITY.  SOMETIMES THIS IS THE
PROBLEM OF BEING HONEST OR HAVING AN IMPETUOUS PERSONALITY OR
HARBORING MANY HOPES -- OR SELLING THEM.

   THE TRUTH IS THAT -- LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO -- WE HAVE A POOR COUNTRY,
A COUNTRY THAT OWES MONEY, A COUNTRY THAT HAS JUST AS MUCH OR MORE
SUBVERSIVE TERRORISM, AND THIS MAKES PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE.  I CANNOT
UNDERSTAND IT.  HOWEVER, THAT IS WHAT WE POLITICIANS ARE FOR -- TO
BURN OUT IN OUR WORK FOR DEMOCRACY TO SURVIVE.  I WILL BE REPLACED BY
SOMEONE ELSE WHO THINKS LIKE ME OR TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ME.  HE WILL
REPLACE ME AND DEMOCRACY WILL STAY, A CIVILIZED SYSTEM. THIS IS THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING.  [CONTINUED]
