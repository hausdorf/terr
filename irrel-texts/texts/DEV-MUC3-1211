DEV-MUC3-1211 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN
COMMANDER SANCHO BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[REPORTER] COMMANDER, THE FIGHTERS, EVEN SALVADORAN CITIZENS IN
GENERAL, DO NOT UNDERSTAND CERTAIN ATTITUDES OF THE FMLN OR SOME OF
THE COMMUNIQUES ISSUED BY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND.  WE SPENT EIGHT OR
NINE YEARS FIGHTING THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] AND JOSE
NAPOLEON DUARTE.  WE REMEMBER [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ASSASSINATION OF
HERBERT ANAYA SANABRIA.  HOWEVER, WHEN DUARTE DIED, A COMMUNIQUE WAS
ISSUED DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT THE FUNERAL COULD TAKE PLACE
PEACEFULLY.  HOW SHOULD WE VIEW ALL OF THESE APPARENT CHANGES OF
POSITION BY THE FMLN?

   [SANCHO] AS FOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WE HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT
ADDITION TO BEING A POLITICAL FORCE, THE FMLN HAS HUMAN SENSITIVITY.
WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TAKE THIS HUMANE ACTION BY
DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT MR. DUARTE COULD BE BURIED.  WE ALSO HAVE TO
MENTION THAT THE PDC AND ALL OF THE LEFTIST FORCES OF THE COUNTRY CAN
CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE DEPOLARIZATION OF SOCIETY.  THE TRUCE WAS A
GESTURE, IT WAS TO MAKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE
TO DEPOLARIZE SOCIETY AND THAT EACH OF US CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.

   THAT IS WHY WE INSIST THAT ONE MUST NOT RETURN TO ONE'S ELECTORAL
OR POLITICAL HEGEMONIC PLANS, BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBSTRUCT THE UNITY OF
THE PEOPLE, WHICH IS NEEDED TO ISOLATE THE FASCISTS.

   [REPORTER] COMMANDER, THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AT THE LEGISLATIVE
ASSEMBLY WHEN DUARTE DIED BECAUSE THE PDC LEGISLATORS MOTIONED TO NAME
HIM THE FATHER OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WHO WAS IN POWER FOR
ALMOST 10 YEARS, AND ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON?  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE TWO POLITICIANS?

   [SANCHO] WE BELIEVE THAT DUARTE WAS A FIGHTER FOR DEMOCRACY.  HE
HAD HIS OWN BELIEFS, HE HAD HIS OWN PERSONALITY, AND HE REALLY HAD
CHARISMA; WE CANNOT DENY THAT.  OF COURSE, WE CANNOT COMPARE HIM TO A
CRIMINAL WHO IS BEING SOUGHT BY JUSTICE.  I WOULD SAY THAT D'AUBUISSON
IS A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE, WHO HAS SOUGHT SHELTER FROM HIS IMMUNITY
AS A DEPUTY.  HIS IMMUNITY AS A DEPUTY DOES NOT PRECLUDE HIS CRIMES.
THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN DUARTE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHO IS
WELL-KNOWN, BUT IS VIOLENT AND UNPOPULAR.

   [REPORTER] TO END THE FIRST PART OF THE INTERVIEW, ARE YOU
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A POSSIBLE CONCERTED EFFORT BY POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC
FORCES IN THE COUNTRY OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EACH WILL GO HIS OWN WAY.
ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A CONCERTED EFFORT?

   [SANCHO] A CONCERTED EFFORT IN A POLITICAL STRUGGLE OF ALL THE
FORCES IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD NOT ONLY BE SEEN AS A POSSIBILITY, BUT
MUST BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL NECESSITY FOR THE UNITY OF ALL POPULAR AND
NATIONAL SECTORS, BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY FORMULA TO REBUILD
THE COUNTRY, TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY, AND TO RECONCILE THE COUNTRY.
THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A CONCERTED POLITICAL EFFORT.  I BELIEVE
THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS FOR CONCERTED
POLITICAL EFFORTS, WHICH WILL REALLY GIVE NEW HOPE TO THE LARGE
MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE MUST NOT FORGET ABOUT THE LARGE
MAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE SPEAK ON
BEHALF OF CERTAIN GROUPS OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE
MAJORITIES.
