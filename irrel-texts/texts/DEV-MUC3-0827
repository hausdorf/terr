   SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE THREE SPANISH
MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, FREED TODAY BY THE
SALVADORAN NATIONAL GUARD, SAID THAT THE AUTHORITIES ORDERED THEM TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WERE SUSPECTED OF COLLABORATING WITH
"TERRORIST DELINQUENTS."

   "WE ARE BEING THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY," SAID FRANCES RIERA, ONE
OF THE SPANIARDS DETAINED THIS MORNING TOGETHER WITH HIS FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN ESTHER DOMENECH AND LUIS PEREZ, A GUATEMALAN UNDER REFUGE
AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH, AND ANOTHER THREE FOREIGNERS -- A COLOMBIAN,
A CANADIAN, AND AN AMERICAN.

   RIERA SAID THEY WERE DETAINED AT 1005 GMT, WHILE THE CITY WAS
"UNDER CURFEW" AND UNDER A "STATE OF SIEGE," AND THAT NATIONAL GUARD
MEMBERS "KNOCKED ON THE DOOR, ENTERED, SEPARATED US, TOOK THE
FOREIGNERS ASIDE, AND DELIVERED US AN ANTICOMMUNIST HARANGUE."

   "THEY TOLD US THEY WERE ARRESTING US FOR OUR OWN PROTECTION BECAUSE
FOREIGNERS WERE BEING THREATENED BY TERRORIST DELINQUENTS.  AT THE
NATIONAL GUARD WE WERE MADE TO SIGN A STATEMENT IN WHICH WE APPEAR AS
SUSPECTS OF COLLABORATING WITH TERRORIST DELINQUENTS," RIERA ADDED.

   THE THREE SPANIARDS ARE AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY, AFTER AMBASSADOR
FRANCISCO CADIZ IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION TO GET THEM FREED.

   A TOTAL OF 15 PEOPLE WERE DETAINED, NINE OF THEM SALVADORANS, AND
WE "KNOW NOTHING OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS," RIERA SAID.  HE ADDED THAT
THEY HAD REMAINED IN DETENTION FOR OVER 1 HOUR, STRESSING THAT "WE
WERE NEVER MISTREATED NOR WERE WE ASKED ANY QUESTIONS."

   RIERA SAID THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 135 PEOPLE AT THE EPISCOPAL
CHURCH WHO WERE LEFT HOMELESS BY THE WAR, AND MORE ARE EXPECTED TODAY.

   "PEOPLE HAVE TO REMAIN THERE (AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH) BECAUSE THEY
HAVE NO PLACE TO GO.  THERE ARE NO PLACES LEFT AFTER THE SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE BOMBINGS," RIERA STRESSED.

   HE ADDED THAT THE CHURCH "HAS EVIDENCE THAT WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS
WERE SET ON FIRE."

   RIERA REPORTED THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST "ARMED MEN, DRESSED IN
MILITARY UNIFORMS," ENTERED HIS HOME AND "INTIMIDATED US."

   THE THREE FREED SPANIARDS WILL RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO
MADRID, VIA GUATEMALA, A SPOKESMAN FOR THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN SAN
SALVADOR REPORTED.
