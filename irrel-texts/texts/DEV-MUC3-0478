   BOGOTA, 14 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND
THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19) HAVE POSTPONED SIGNING A PEACE AGREEMENT
BUT HAVE NOT BROKEN OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS, AN M-19 SPOKESMAN ANNOUNCED
TODAY.

   RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE AFFAIRS,
ANNOUNCED THAT AFTER THE TALKS ON 13 SEPTEMBER IN SANTO DOMINGO (400
KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA), THE AGREEMENT FOR THE M-19 TO DEMOBILIZE AND
RETURN TO POLITICAL LIFE WAS POSTPONED.

   IN STATEMENTS BY TELEPHONE TO REUTER FROM SANTO DOMINGO, HIPOLITO
BLANCO, A RANKING M-19 SPOKESMAN, SAID "WE HOPE TO HOLD ANOTHER
MEETING SOON; THE TOPICS WE MUST AGREE UPON ARE COMPLEX AND WE MUST
TAKE TIME TO ANALYZE THEM."

   BLANCO POINTED OUT THAT "YESTERDAY'S MEETING WAS CHARACTERIZED BY
CORDIALITY," BUT "THE MECHANISMS TO BROADEN DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY
AND DEMOBILIZATION" ARE ISSUES THAT MUST STILL BE STUDIED IN-DEPTH.

   BLANCO ADMITTED THAT ONE OF THE SUBJECTS BEING CONSIDERED IS A
PARDON FOR M-19 MEMBERS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE
VIOLENT OCCUPATION OF THE JUSTICE PALACE IN NOVEMBER 1985, WHEN
APPROXIMATELY 100 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

   THE M-19 IS ONE OF SIX ACTIVE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN COLOMBIA AND THE
ONE THAT HAS MADE THE GREATEST PROGRESS IN PEACE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT.

   THE GROUP IS NATIONALIST IN IDEOLOGY.  IT HAS 1,000 ARMED MEN, IS
BEST KNOWN FOR ITS SPECTACULAR OPERATIONS, AND MAY WELL BECOME THE
FIRST COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS INDEFINITELY.

   THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SIGNED A PEACE AGREEMENT ON 17 MARCH
AND OPENED TALKS IN MAY WITH POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS CALLED
"WORKING TABLES."

   THE INITIAL RESULTS OF THE "WORKING TABLES" -- WHICH ENDED THE
FIRST WEEK OF JULY -- WILL BE PRESENTED TO CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENCY
IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS, LAWS,
OR DECREES.

   SOME OF THE REFORMS DEAL WITH THE REPRESENTATION OF MINORITY GROUPS
IN CONGRESS AND MECHANISMS FOR THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS.

   OTHER GUERRILLA ORGANIZATIONS WILL PROBABLY MEET WITH THE
GOVERNMENT THIS MONTH TO SPEED UP THE PEACEMAKING PROCESS.

   THE ONLY GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS STAYED AWAY FROM THE PEACE
PROCESS IS THE CASTROITE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY, WHICH CEASED
BOMBING PIPELINES ON 25 AUGUST, BUT HAS CONTINUED ITS GUERRILLA
OPERATIONS.

   ACCORDING TO MILITARY ESTIMATES, THE SIX INSURGENT GROUPS IN
COLOMBIA HAVE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 7,000 ARMED MEN.
