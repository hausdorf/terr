   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 10 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT]
[NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO BROCKMAN] [TEXT] I CAME
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT OUR REPORTER FRIENDS WERE GREATLY INTERESTED
IN KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING.  I UNDERSTAND THAT ATTITUDE BECAUSE I
WORKED AS A NEWSMAN FOR MANY YEARS.  I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOUR NEED TO
TRANSMIT INFORMATION TO OUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE SO
INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' SUMMIT,
AND TO THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, WHO ARE INTERESTED THAT
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TOWARD A FINAL PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   YESTERDAY EVENING, THE FOREIGN MINISTERS AGREED NOT TO SPEAK TO THE
PRESS INDIVIDUALLY.  WE APPOINTED COSTA RICAN FOREIGN MINISTER RODRIGO
MADRIGAL NIETO AS OUR SPOKESMAN.  HE SAID WHAT WE HAD AGREED TO SAY AT
THAT TIME.  IN FACT, THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE TO REPORT NOW.  FOREIGN
MINISTER MADRIGAL NIETO TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS
HAD BASICALLY DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO EXAMINING THREE TOPICS.  WE ALSO
HAD TWO MORE TOPICS, BUT IN ALL THERE WERE THREE TOPICS.  I THINK HE
MENTIONED THE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN EL
SALVADOR, AND A THIRD TOPIC, BUT RIGHT NOW I DO NOT DARE TO SAY WHAT
IT WAS LEST I MAKE A MISTAKE.  [AT THIS POINT, AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON
INTERRUPTS, SAYING: "ONUCA"]

   HE MENTIONED ONUCA [UN OBSERVER GROUP IN CENTRAL AMERICA].
THAT IS CORRECT.  IN FACT, WE DISCUSSED FIVE TOPICS, BUT IF HE
SAID...[CHANGES THOUGHT] ONUCA WAS ONE OF THEM.  SO WE HAVE
DEMOBILIZATION, THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, AND ONUCA.  THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO THESE THREE TOPICS.

   THIS WAS NOT SO EASY.  SOME SAY THE THING TO DO IS TO CLEARLY AND
CATEGORICALLY CONDEMN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT] FOR...[CHANGES THOUGHT] AND TO DESCRIBE IT AS A
TERRORIST GROUP.  OTHERS SAY: LET US CONDEMN TERRORISM IN GENERAL, AND
ALSO ANYONE WHO USES IT.  SOME ATTACH A GREAT DEAL OF IMPORTANCE TO
WHAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SPECIALIZING IN DEFENDING AND
PROMOTING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS SAY, NAMELY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, AMERICA'S WATCH, THE GENEVA-BASED INTERNATIONAL
LEAGUE OF JURISTS, THE OAS' INTER-AMERICAN COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS,
THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, THE UN'S TASK FORCE ON FORCED
DISAPPEARANCES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CATHOLIC INSTITUTE IN
LONDON, ENGLAND.  ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY FROM THE
NICARAGUAN STANDPOINT DESERVE RESPECT AND CREDIBILITY, INDICATE
MATTERS ARE NOT SIMPLY BLACK AND WHITE.  [CONTINUED]
