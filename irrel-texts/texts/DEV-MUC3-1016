   LIMA, 20 DEC 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [TEXT] THE PANAMANIAN CHARGE
D'AFFAIRS IN OUR COUNTRY, JAIME CERDA, DID NOT [AS HEARD] MAKE AN URGENT
CALL TO ALL LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. INTERVENTION IN HIS
COUNTRY.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CERDA] WE DEFINITELY CALL ON THE WORLD, ON THE
CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD, TO END THIS SITUATION.

   [REPORTER] IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE TORRIJOS-CARTER TREATY COULD
BE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS CONFLICT THAT HAS BEEN BREWING FOR
SOME TIME BETWEEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE PANAMANIAN STATE.  DO
YOU BELIEVE, AS A CITIZEN, THAT THERE IS A SHORT-TERM SOLUTION TO THIS
CONFLICT?

   [CERDA] THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE GOOD FAITH OF THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
TOWARD PANAMANIANS.  I BELIEVE THAT NO PEOPLE, NO MAN, INDEPENDENTLY
OF WHAT HE MAY THINK OF THE GOVERNMENTS, CAN AGREE WITH THIS TYPE OF
INTERVENTION BY THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL POWER DIRECTED AGAINST A
SMALL PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONFRONT THE MILITARY
MIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS AGENCIES
REPORTS, CIVILIANS ARE BEING KILLED THERE ARE MANY MILITIAMEN WHO ARE
FIGHTING THE U.S. SOLDIERS.  I REITERATE MY CALL TO THE PEOPLE OF THE
WORLD, ON THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE, ON OUR PERUVIAN BROTHERS TO
DECLARE THEMSELVES AGAINST THIS ACT OF AGGRESSION THAT CANNOT BE
TOLERATED BY FREE NATIONS.

   [REPORTER] IN PANAMA, WHERE ARE THE CLASHES TAKING PLACE?

   [CERDA] IN PANAMA CITY.  INTERNATIONAL PRESS DISPATCHES HAVE
MENTIONED THIS.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE SOCIAL COST SO FAR?  IS THERE SOME ESTIMATE?

   [CERDA] WELL, INTERNATIONAL DISPATCHES SPEAK OF 50 DEAD, MOSTLY
CIVILIANS.  FROM THE SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL, WHICH IS A PUBLIC HEALTH
HOSPITAL, THERE HAS BEEN NO INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT
BEEN GIVEN MEDICAL ATTENTION, NOR FROM OTHER HOSPITALS.
