   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV 89 -- [SPEECH] [DEFENSE MINISTER] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] THE PEOPLE ARE PUNISHING THE FMLN.  THIS VIOLENCE, THIS
BLOODSHED CAUSED BY THIS TERRORIST AGGRESSION -- SPECIFICALLY THAT
BLOOD -- IS PRECISELY THE INSPIRATION WE HAVE FOR DEFEATING AND
BREAKING THE WILL TO FIGHT OF THIS TERRORIST FMLN.  WE WILL PREVAIL;
WE WILL WIN.  FIRST, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TRUTH; SECOND, BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE THAT, AS CHRISTIANS, GOD IS WITH US; AND THIRD, BECAUSE WE
HAVE AN INDOMITABLE ESPRIT DE CORPS AS A PROFESSIONAL ARMY, AND WE ARE
DETERMINED TODAY -- AS BEFORE AND AS ALWAYS -- TO DEFEND OUR
TERRITORY, OUR HISTORY, OUR VALUES, OUR PRINCIPLES, AND TO DEFEND AND
PROTECT THE DIGNITY OF EACH AND EVERY SALVADORAN CITIZEN.

   WE ARE DEEPLY THANKFUL TO OUR PEOPLE FOR THEIR COURAGEOUS AND
HEROIC ATTITUDE.  WE ARE DEEPLY THANKFUL FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT THE
PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN THE ARMED FORCES. WE TAKE IT AS A CHALLENGE, AND YOU
CAN REST ASSURED, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THAT JUST AS I, A SOLDIER OF THIS
FATHERLAND AND OF OUR ARMED FORCES, HAVE, ALL OF THOSE BEHIND ME HAVE
THE SAME RESOLVE TO STRUGGLE AND THE SAME SPIRIT TO FACE -- TODAY,
TOMORROW, AND ALWAYS -- THE TERRORIST CHALLENGE TO WHICH, TODAY AND IN
THE COMING HOURS, WE WILL RESPOND BY GIVING THEM A LESSON IN
PROFESSIONALISM.  OUR ATTITUDE IS PRECISELY ONE OF DEFENDING AND
GUARANTEEING THOSE RIGHTS, THAT SPIRIT, AND THAT RESOLVE, AND OF
DEFENDING AND GUARANTEEING THE SUPREME POSTULATES CONTAINED IN THE
CONSTITUTION.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE ASK FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE, FAITH, AND HOPE IN
GOD AND IN THE ARMED FORCES.  REST ASSURED THAT VERY SHORTLY WE WILL
HAVE VICTORY ON OUR SIDE.  THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT, FOR THE
ENCOURAGEMENT, AND -- SALVADORAN PEOPLE -- RECEIVE FROM THE ARMED
FORCES RESPECTFUL AND CORDIAL GREETINGS, AND THE ASSURANCES THAT YOUR
ARMED FORCES WILL VERY SOON RESOLVE THIS VIOLENCE IMPOSED BY
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.

   AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC REQUESTED, WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU
REMAIN CALM AND STAY AT HOME.  I BELIEVE THAT FOR REASONS OF YOUR OWN
SECURITY, IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO LEAVE YOUR HOMES.  THE SITUATION IS
BEING CONTROLLED SLOWLY.

   THE MAIN PROBLEMS NOW ARE IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL
CITY.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THE SITUATION
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  MEANWHILE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, HAVE FAITH,
HOPE, AND CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ARMED FORCES, IN GOD AND IN THE
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE.  THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON.
