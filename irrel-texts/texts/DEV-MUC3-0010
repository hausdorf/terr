   LIMA, 9 JAN 90 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA
HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE U.S.  TROOPS THAT SURROUNDED OUR DIPLOMATIC
MISSION IN PANAMA WERE WITHDRAWN AFTER A FORMER MINISTER SURNAMED
CORDOVA LEFT THE EMBASSY.  THE MILITARY MAN, WHO IS INVOLVED IN A
MURDER TRIAL, LEFT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AS SOON AS HE LEARNED THAT THE
EMBASSY CONSIDERED HIM PERSONA NON GRATA.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GARCIA] I THINK JOURNALISTS HAVE MAGNIFIED THE ISSUE A
BIT.  AS FAR AS WE KNOW, PEOPLE SOUGHT PROTECTION....[CHANGES THOUGHT]
SOMEONE ARRIVES AT THE DOOR OF THE EMBASSY AND ASKS FOR REFUGE IN VIEW OF A
SITUATION OF FORCE.  THE SITUATION IN PANAMA IS ABNORMAL; IT HAS BEEN
TOTALLY INVADED BY 30,000 SOLDIERS.

   SOME PERSONS ENTERED THE EMBASSY.  AT LEAST ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN ALLEGEDLY
LINKED WITH THE DEATH OF A PANAMANIAN MINISTER, A MR SPADAFORA, WHO WAS
MURDERED. THE AUTHORITIES OF THE EMBASSY AND OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY STATED
THAT THIS PERSON'S PRESENCE WAS UNDESIRABLE.  WE DO NOT REFUSE TO GRANT
REFUGE--A CONDITION THAT IS GRANTED BEFORE GRANTING POLITICAL ASYLUM--TO
WHOMEVER FEELS HARASSED OR MISTREATED.  IN A CASE LIKE THIS, HOWEVER, IN
WHICH THERE WAS AN ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN A MURDER WHICH WAS COMMITTED YEARS
AGO, THIS PERSON--I BELIEVE HE IS A MAN SURNAMED CORDOVA, APPARENTLY A
HIGHRANKING PANAMANIAN GUARD OFFICER--WAS TOLD THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS NOT
WANTED.  HE LEFT THE EMBASSY OF HIS OWN WILL.

   THERE ARE OTHER PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS AT THE EMBASSY,
INCLUDING MR NORIEGA'S SECRETARY, BUT THEIR STATUS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY
PERU.

   AN INCIDENT WAS REPORTED YESTERDAY, AS THE U.S. TROOPS SURROUNDED THE
EMBASSY, DEPLOYING BARRIERS AND BARBED WIRE.

   THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEPICT A DRAMATIC AND SPECTACULAR PICTURE OF A
SIEGE OR PERHAPS OF AN INVASION OF THE EMBASSY. 

   FORTUNATELY, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY RESORTED TO DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS AND THE
TROOPS WERE SOON WITHDRAWN. [END RECORDING]
