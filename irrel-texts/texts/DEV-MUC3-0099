DEV-MUC3-0099 (NOSC)

   LIMA, 29 MAR 89 -- [TEXT] JUSTICE MINISTER CESAR DELGADO BARRETO SAID
TODAY THAT THE TRAGIC INCIDENT AT UCHIZA DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS AN
ALLIANCE BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND TERRORISTS, AND THAT THE COUNTRY
SHOULD MAKE A MORE INTENSE EFFORT AGAINST THEM.  HE SAID THAT THE ATTACK
IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLOWS THAT POLICE HAVE DEALT TO DRUG
TRAFFICKERS, INCLUDING THE ARREST OF SEVERAL DRUG GANG LEADERS IN UCHIZA,
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK.  HE ADDED THAT IN ORDER TO STRUGGLE
SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, PERU NEEDS MORE TECHNOLOGICAL AND
FINANCIAL AID, ESPECIALLY FROM THE UNITED STATES, THE WORLD'S LARGEST DRUG
CONSUMER.
