   SAN SALVADOR, 16 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] COMMANDER FACUNDO
GUARDADO, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN
THE PAST DECADE, TODAY SAID THAT THE ARMY'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE IN SAN
SALVADOR "IS AT A STALEMATE," WHILE THE "REBELS ARE ADVANCING."

   GUARDADO, WEARING AN OLIVE GREEN UNIFORM, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE
GUERRILLAS' OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER, SURPRISED THE ARMED
FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS "MOTIVATED WARMONGERING
SECTORS IN THIS COUNTRY TO CONTINUE REPRESSION."

   THE GUERRILLA LEADER, KNOWN AS "ESTEBAN," SAID: "WE ARE WILLING TO
NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE WAR FROM
HERE [SAN SALVADOR], WHILE WE CONTINUE TO HOLD THESE TERRITORIES (IN
SAN SALVADOR)."  HE ADDED: "WE WOULD HAVE TO ASK ARMY CHIEFS IF THESE
ARE THE SO-CALLED UNDELIMITED BORDER AREAS BORDERING HONDURAS."

   THE SALVADORAN ARMY HAS REPEATEDLY CHARGED THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) WITH SEEKING REFUGE IN "UNDELIMITED
BORDER AREAS" IN DISPUTE WITH HONDURAS.

   GUARDADO WAS INTERVIEWED NEAR A CLINIC IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.
HE WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED TO THE PRESS OF THE
SALVADORAN AIR FORCE'S "INDISCRIMINATE" BOMBINGS.

   "WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE OUR HOMES.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO
DO.  WE ASK YOU (THE PRESS) TO REPORT THAT THE AIR FORCE IS BOMBING
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS," A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING A WHITE FLAG AND SAYING
GOOD-BYE TO HIS NEIGHBORS SAID.

   THE GUERRILLAS PRESENTED TO THE PRESS TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE
DETAINED ON 15 NOVEMBER AS SOLDIERS TRIED TO EXPEL REBELS FROM
MEJICANOS, A DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE
SOLDIERS, APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS OLD, IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS JOSE
FRANCISCO RAMIREZ AND SANTOS LOPEZ.  "WE WERE CAPTURED YESTERDAY.  WE
WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVE BEEN FED.  WE DO NOT CONSIDER OURSELVES
PRISONERS OF WAR," RAMIREZ SAID.  LOPEZ SAID HE HAD ENTERED THE
MEJICANOS AREA WITH 45 OTHER SOLDIERS, BUT "ALL OF THEM LEFT."
