   GUATEMALA CITY, 1 MAR 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT
VINICIO CEREZO HAS ACCUSED U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS STROOK OF
INTERFERING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   "IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR AN AMBASSADOR OF ANY COUNTRY TO OPENLY
INTERFERE IN THE INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY," SAID CEREZO
TODAY IN REFERENCE TO THE U.S. DIPLOMAT.  STROOK HAD EXPRESSED HIS
CONCERN THIS WEEK OVER THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION AND THE
GUATEMALAN OFFICIALS' INCOMPETENCE IN CONTROLLING THE SITUATION.

   CEREZO REQUESTED THAT STROOK DEFINE HIS STATUS, "WHETHER AS AN
AMBASSADOR OR A PRIVATE PERSON."  HE ALSO ASKED STROOK TO "CONSULT
WITH HIS GOVERNMENT TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS AN OFFICIAL POLICY OR NOT."

   "IF IT IS, WE WOULD HAVE TO OPEN UP A DISCUSSION WITH THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT," SAID THE PRESIDENT.  HE ADDED THAT HE IS HANDLING THE
MATTER WITH "PRUDENCE AND SENSITIVITY, BUT WITH FIRMNESS."

   CEREZO ALSO NOTED THAT IF STROOK "WANTS TO GIVE PERSONAL OPINIONS
ABOUT GUATEMALAN PROBLEMS, HE WILL HAVE TO DO SO INDEPENDENTLY FROM
HIS POSITION AS AMBASSADOR."

   DURING A SPEECH GIVEN TO ROTARY CLUB MEMBERS ON 27 FEBRUARY, THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR CRITICIZED HOW THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT
DEALT WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION.

   THE DIPLOMAT STATED THEN: "I WOULD NOT BE SINCERE IF I TOLD YOU
THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS, AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
NOT SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION."

   "THE MURDER AND KIDNAPPING OF STUDENTS, POLITICAL LEADERS,
PEASANTS, AND WORKERS HAVE US DEEPLY WORRIED," HE ADDED, NOTING THAT
"THE CONTINOUS REPORTS ABOUT UNKNOWN PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED OR
KIDNAPPED IN THE COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS HAVE NOT ONLY GREATLY DISTURBED
PEOPLE IN GUATEMALA, BUT ALSO THE WORLD OVER."

   STROOK STATED HE WAS SURPRISED THAT IN NONE OF THE CASES HAD THE
GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE AND TAKE TO COURT "THE
VILE AND COWARDLY CRIMINALS WHO HAD COMMITTED THESE ABOMINABLE ACTS."

   DURING HIS SPEECH THE DIPLOMAT ALSO CRITICIZED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING
SITUATION IN GUATEMALA AND "THE SAD SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REALITY" OF
THE COUNTRY, WHERE MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S 9 MILLION INHABITANTS LIVE IN
ABJECT POVERTY.
