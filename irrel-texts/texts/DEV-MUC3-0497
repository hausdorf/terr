   HAVANA (CUBA), 16 SEP 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[MANOLO ORTEGA] [TEXT] FOR THE FIRST TIME IN VIRTUALLY 10 YEARS OF
ARMED CONFLICT, WHICH HAS CLAIMED ALMOST 70,000 LIVES, THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLAS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT RECENTLY IN MEXICO CITY.
THIS COULD MARK THE BEGINNING OF AN UNPRECEDENTED PATH OF PEACE FOR
THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   AFTER 2 DAYS OF TALKS, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
[FMLN] REPRESENTATIVES AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES AGREED TO
ESTABLISH A PERMANENT DIALOGUE TO SECURE A DEFINITE CEASE-FIRE.  ON 16
AND 17 OCTOBER, THE COSTA RICAN CAPITAL WILL HOST THE MEETING BETWEEN
THE NEGOTIATING PARTIES.  THE EVENT WILL BE ATTENDED BY TWO
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS MEDIATORS FOR THE SALVADORAN
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE.  UN AND OAS REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE INVITED TO
ATTEND AS WITNESSES.

   ASIDE FROM MATTERS OF PROCEDURE, IT IS WORTHWHILE TO SAY THAT, IN
ADDITION TO BEING DECISIVE IN ACHIEVING A SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN
INTERNAL CRISIS, THE REBELS' RECENT PEACE INITIATIVE WAS A STRONG BLOW
TO THE RULING ULTRA-RIGHTIST SECTOR.  THE REBELS' WILLINGNESS TO END
HOSTILITIES AND TURN THE FMLN INTO A POLITICAL PARTY PLACED BEFORE
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI THE DECISION OF CONTINUING THE WAR OR
OPTING FOR PEACE.

   AS OF THAT MOMENT, AND IN VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE ASSIGNED TO THE
TALKS BY THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA AND ANALYSTS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC
OPINION KEPT ABREAST OF THE DIALOGUE, WHICH IS SO VITAL FOR EL
SALVADOR AND FOR CENTRAL AMERICA.  FOR THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE [ARENA], THE PROPOSALS WERE CLEARLY DEFINED TO AGREE ON A
TOTAL CEASE-FIRE BEFORE 31 JANUARY, TO END THE REPRESSION, TO CONDUCT
A PURGE IN THE ARMY, AND TO REORGANIZE THE JUDICIAL AND ELECTORAL
SYSTEM.

   ALTHOUGH DETAILS WERE NOT GIVEN ON HOW THE ISSUES WILL BE HANDLED,
THE FACT REMAINS THAT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES WILL BEGIN
IN ONLY A MONTH.  IT MEANS THAT THE VEILED GOVERNMENT INTENTION TO
DELAY THE TALKS AND CONTINUE THE WAR, WHICH IT CANNOT WIN IN ANY
EVENT, HAS FAILED.  WE MIGHT EVEN ADD THAT THE ARENA GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE FROM THE BEGINNING, ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE
TELA SUMMIT WHICH APPEALED TO THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES TO HOLD
DIALOGUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THE REBELS.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S
ATTEMPT TO SECURE THE FORCEFUL DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS AND
HIS ATTEMPT TO COMPARE THESE FORCES WITH THE NICARAGUAN
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES ALSO FAILED.

   THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AND ITS
WILLINGNESS TO SECURE A DEFINITIVE PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE IN EVIDENCE
AT THE NEXT MEETINGS.  MEANWHILE, THE PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING PEACE IN
THE COUNTRY APPEAR TO BE FAVORABLE.
