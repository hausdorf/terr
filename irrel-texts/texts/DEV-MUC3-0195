   TEGUCIGALPA, 1 MAY 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] HONDURAN WORKERS TODAY
DEMANDED THE EXPULSION OF U.S. TROOPS AND NICARAGUAN CONTRAS FROM THE
COUNTRY, AND THEY DEMANDED HIGHER WAGES, MEASURES TO CONTROL INFLATION,
AND THE CREATION OF NEW JOBS.

   THE ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING WAS MORE MARKED AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE
LEFTIST UNITED FEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS (FUTH), WHO BURNED EIGHT U.S.
FLAGS.

   THE DEMONSTRATORS ALSO BURNED A COFFIN SYMBOLIZING THE BURIAL OF THE
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT (AID).  THEY ALSO BURNED A SCALE MODEL OF THE U.S. PALMEROLA
MILITARY BASE IN CENTRAL HONDURAS.  

   THE HONDURAN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS HELD SEPARATE MARCHES.  THOSE OF THE
RIGHT ENDED THEIR DEMONSTRATION AT THE CENTRAL SQUARE, IN FRONT OF THE
STATUE OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HERO FRANCISCO MORAZAN, WHILE THOSE OF THE LEFT
ENDED THEIR MARCH IN FRONT OF THE MANUEL BONILLA NATIONAL THEATER.

   THE CONSERVATIVE CONFEDERATION OF HONDURAN WORKERS (CTH) AND THE GENERAL
WORKERS FEDERATION (CGT) ALSO CONDEMNED THE PRESENCE OF U.S.  TROOPS AND OF
MORE THAN 10,000 NICARAGUAN CONTRAS IN THE COUNTRY.

   "YANKEES GET OUT OF HONDURAS," "CONTRAS GET OUT," "TO PAY THE FOREIGN
DEBT IS TO KILL THE PEOPLE," AND "JOBS AND NOT MORE MILITARY AID" WERE SOME
OF THE SLOGANS ON PLACARDS AND BANNERS CARRIED BY THE WORKERS.

   THE SPEAKERS FROM THE MAIN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS DEMANDED THAT PRESIDENT
JOSE AZCONA'S GOVERNMENT RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, AMEND THE LABOR CODE, REFORM
THE SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTE, INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE, AND RESPECT THE
RIGHT TO WORK AND JOB SECURITY.

   "WE WANT A FREEZE ON PRICES OF STAPLES, HOUSING PROGRAMS, RESPECT FOR
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, DEMOCRATIZATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT," CTH SECRETARY GENERAL
VICTOR ARTILES SAID.

   THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS STRESSED THAT THERE CAN BE NO PEACE IN THE
COUNTRY WITH MORE THAN 1.2 MILLION UNEMPLOYED AND A POPULATION WITH
DEFICIENT HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND FOOD SERVICES.

   THEY ALSO SAID THEY ARE AGAINST THE SHIPMENT OF WEAPONS TO HONDURAS AND
AGAINST THE CREATION OF NEW MILITARY UNITS.  

   FUTH PRESIDENT HECTOR HERNANDEZ SAID THAT HONDURAS "IS NOT ONLY FACING
CONSTANT PRESSURE TO DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY BUT ALSO DAILY PRESSURE TO DEVALUE
OUR DIGNITY AS A NATION."

   HERNANDEZ CONDEMNED THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS AND THE CONTRAS, AND HE
SAID THAT "EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO MAKE US PAY FOR A FOREIGN DEBT WE DO
NOT OWE."

   "THAT DEBT WAS PAID A LONG TIME AGO, AND WE MUST ASK WHETHER IT IS THE
DEVELOPED CAPITALIST COUNTRIES THAT OWE US BECAUSE OF THEIR LOOTING OF OUR
NATURAL RESOURCES," HE ADDED.

   OSCAR ANIBAL PUERTO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE HONDURAN HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE
COMMITTEE (CODEH), SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES, AND NOT THE HONDURAN
GOVERNMENT, IS THE ONE THAT ISSUES THE NATIONAL POLICY GUIDELINES.

   PUERTO CONDEMNED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THROUGH
ILLEGAL ARRESTS AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE.
