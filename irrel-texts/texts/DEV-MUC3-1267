DEV-MUC3-1267 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH MNR'S
UNGO BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] I HAVE
ANOTHER QUESTION.  A FEW MOMENTS AGO, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI TERMED THE
MOST RIDICULOUS COMMUNIQUE HE HAD EVER HEARD FROM THE FMLN THE ONE IN
WHICH THEY JUSTIFIED YESTERDAY'S MILITARY ACTIONS.  HE TERMED THEM
PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED.  WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, HOW DO
YOU VIEW THIS?

   [UNGO] IN MY OPINION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE HAS ASPECTS THAT ARE
INTERESTING AND OTHERS WHICH I THINK ARE NOT VALID.  THE TIME AND
OPPORTUNITY OF THAT ACTION IS AMBIVALENT.  I THINK IT HAS NEGATIVE
EFFECTS, AS WELL AS POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR THEM.  THERE IS ALWAYS THE
FAMOUS VICIOUS CIRCLE WHEREIN IF THE FMLN CEASES TO ACT MILITARILY, IT
IS BAD FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE IT SHOWS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.  IF IT ACTS
MILITARILY IT IS ALSO BAD, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT DOES NOT WANT
PEACE.  IN THIS SENSE, I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT HAS EXHIBITED
A SHOW OF FORCE, THAT ITS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY
PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED OR WITH PROPAGANDA OBJECTIVES.  IT DOES NOT CEASE
TO CREATE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS THAT GENERATE A NEGATIVE REACTION ON
THE OTHER'S PART, IF THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TRY TO EASE
CONFRONTATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE.  I BELIEVE, AS I TOLD PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ON THE TELEPHONE
YESTERDAY WHEN WE SPOKE OF OTHER THINGS BUT TOUCHED ON THIS TOPIC,
THAT I UPHOLD THE GOVERNMENT'S THESIS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS CRITICIZED THE
FACT THAT WHEN NEGATIVE THINGS OCCUR, THEY ARE INVOKED TO SUSPEND A
PROCESS WHICH IN OUR OPINION SHOULD BE CONTINUOUS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS
UPHELD THE CONTINUITY OF THE DIALOGUE.  THE GOVERNMENT CRITICIZED THE
FMLN WHEN ON TWO OCCASIONS IT SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE DUE TO TERRORIST
ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OR SECURITY CORPS.  THE DIALOGUE
AND NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THIS.  I BELIEVE
THAT IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE ITS OWN MEDICINE.  IT
SHOULD MAINTAIN THE CONTINUITY OF THE PROCESS AND NOT USE AS A PRETEXT
THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS TO TRY TO SEEK WAYS OF CONDITIONING OR
PERTURBING A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, WHICH INVOLVES NOT
ONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, BUT THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL
FORCES AS WELL.

   [REPORTER] DR. UNGO, IN THAT SENSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED
THROUGH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THAT THE DIALOGUE WOULD BE RESUMED ON 3
MAY.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S ENVOY ANNOUNCED THAT IT
WOULD BE THE FIRST PART OF MAY.  DON'T YOU THINK THAT TOO MUCH TIME IS
BEING SPENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO AGREE ON SUMMIT MEETINGS THAT WILL
PERMIT SECURING AGREEMENTS?

   [UNGO] I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW THE PROCESS IS
DEVELOPING IN THIS FIRST PHASE, JUDGING BY THE CONDUCT ON THE PART OF
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.  I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A DELAY, BUT I
THINK IT IS A DELAY THAT IMPROVES THE POSSIBILITIES AND CONDITIONS.
APPARENTLY THE TIMES WERE MARKED BY HASTE AND PRECIPITATION FOR THE
FMLN TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL.  ALSO, THERE WAS A VERY SHORT TIME FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO PREPARE ITS RESPONSE AND HOLD A BILATERAL MEETING LATER.
AT THE SAME TIME, IT LEFT A VERY NARROW MARGIN OF INFLUENCE TO THE
POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HIMSELF CONVENED THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO
EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AND HOW HE VIEWED THE ROLE OF
THE PARTIES.  THE PARTIES HAVE THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF THEIR ROLE AND
HAVE BEEN WORKING ARDUOUSLY AND RESPONSIBLY.  IN TWO WEEKS THEY HELD
FOUR PROLONGED, HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS, TWO PER WEEK.  WE WANT TO DO THE
SAME THING WITH THE FMLN.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PERIOD OF TWO TO THREE
WEEKS TO ONE MONTH, SINCE THE GENEVA AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED, HAS BEEN
POSITIVE.  IF WE HAD HURRIED THINGS UP, PERHAPS THE POSSIBILITY OF
ACHIEVING RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT ALL
OF THIS GIVES WAY TO SOMEWHAT PESSIMISTIC EVALUATIONS, BECAUSE THE
CONFIDENTIALITY WAS VIOLATED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD
THAT THESE THINGS ARE PART OF A PRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL AIDE-MEMOIRE
THAT WAS AGREED TO IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE TWO TOP LEADERS OF THE FMLN
AND THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION WITH UN SECRETARY GENERAL PEREZ DE
CUELLAR'S REPRESENTATIVE.  [CONTINUED]
