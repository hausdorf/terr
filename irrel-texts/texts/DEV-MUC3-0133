   CLANDESTINE, 17 MAR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS DECIDED TO
COMBINE THE PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS WITH AN
INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THIS INCLUDES THE
NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, WHICH WE NOW DECLARE TO BE
INDEFINITE.

   THE REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS BY OUR PEOPLE AND THE IMPACT OF
OUR ACTIONS HAVE LED THE REGIME TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION,
AGGRESSION, AND THREATS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN A BID TO CONFUSE
THE POPULATION AND, IN ADDITION, TO SET THE STAGE FOR AN ELECTORAL FRAUD.

   IN ORDER TO MAKE MATTERS CLEAR TO OUR PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO THE LOCAL AND
INTERNATIONAL PRESS, WE REPORT THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE GAGGING OF THE NATIONAL PRESS IS PART OF THE PLAN TO COVER UP THE
FRAUD THAT WILL BE COMMITTED ON 19 MARCH.  IN ADDITION, THE CONTROL OVER THE
MEDIA IS INTENDED TO ATTRIBUTE TERRORIST ACTIONS TO THE FMLN.

   2.  THE REGIME HAS TRIED TO BLAME US FOR A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, SUCH AS THE
ATTACK ON A RED CROSS AMBULANCE, AMONG OTHERS, FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.  THE
FMLN HAS A DEFINITE POLICY OF NOT HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE
HURLING OF GRENADES AT BUS STOPS IS A COMMON PRACTICE OF ARMY PERSONNEL AND
IT IS THEREFORE PREPOSTEROUS TO BLAME THE FMLN.

   3.  A NUMBER OF FALSE COMMUNIQUES WITH AN OBVIOUS TERRORIST TONE HAVE
APPEARED.  THEY CLUMSILY GLORIFY VIOLENCE AND THREATEN THE PRESS IN TERMS
THAT ARE QUITE UNLIKE THOSE APPEARING IN DOCUMENTS IN WHICH WE OUTLINE OUR
OFFICIAL POSITION.  WE EMPHATICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN HAS IN NO WAY OR AT
ANY TIME THREATENED THE PRESS OR THE CITIZENS.  WE RECALL THE FACT THAT OUR
OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUES ARE SIGNED BY OUR GENERAL COMMAND AND BROADCAST THROUGH
OUR STATIONS.

   WE REITERATE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL THING AT THIS TIME IS TO REINFORCE AND
EXPAND UNITY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS.  THE
STRUGGLE WHICH WE ARE WAGING WITH WEAPONS IN HAND IS AIMED AT AN ARMY THAT
HAS ONCE MORE DENIED TO OUR NATION THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A FORMULA FOR
A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AT AN IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN THE NATION'S HISTORY.

   WE MADE A PROPOSAL TO HOLD FREE ELECTIONS, IN PEACE AND FOR PEACE, BUT
THE ARMY STUBBORNLY INSISTS ON HOLDING FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS, AT WAR AND FOR
WAR.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD DURING WAR.
