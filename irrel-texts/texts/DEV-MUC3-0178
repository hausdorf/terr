   TEGUCIGALPA, 19 APR 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] HONDURAN GUERRILLAS CLAIMED
CREDIT TODAY FOR THE ATTACK ON A U.S. ARMY CONVOY ON 11 APRIL IN NORTHERN
HONDURAS IN WHICH ONE PERSON WAS KILLED, THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND
ONE VEHICLE DESTROYED.

   THE ATTACK ON AN 11-VEHICLE CONVOY CARRYING U.S. AND HONDURAN SOLDIERS
TOOK PLACE 17 KM NORTHEAST OF OLANCHITO, IN YORO DEPARTMENT, ON THE NORTHERN
COAST OF HONDURAS.  

   PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT U.S. AND HONDURAN TROOPS ARE BUILDING A
HIGHWAY FOR MILITARY EMERGENCIES AND CIVIL DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA.

   IN A COMMUNIQUE DISTRIBUTED IN OLANCHITO, THE MORAZANIST PATRIOTIC FRONT
(FPM) CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK, AND SAID THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY
THE RAMON AMAYA AMADOR COMMANDO GROUP [COMANDO RAMON AMAYA AMADOR].

   THE GUERRILLA COMMUNIQUE STATED "THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH RIFLE
FIRE AND HAND GRENADES, WHICH NEUTRALIZED THE REARGUARD OF THE YANKEE CONVOY
AND RESULTED IN ONE DEAD, THREE OR FOUR WOUNDED, AND ONE DESTROYED VEHICLE."

   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDED THAT "THE YANKEES REFUSE TO REPORT THEIR CASUALTIES
SO AS NOT TO DEMORALIZE THEIR TROOPS.  OUR RIFLES WILL BE AIMED AT THE
BLONDS FROM THE NORTH WHO ARE TODAY TRAMPLING ON OUR SACRED FATHERLAND."

   THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA HAVE
CONFIRMED THE ATTACK, BUT THEY DID NOT MENTION ANY CASUALTIES, ALTHOUGH THEY
ADMIT THAT THE LAST VEHICLE IN THE CONVOY WAS "DAMAGED" BY AN EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE THAT WAS HURLED AT IT.

   ON 1 FEBRUARY, ANOTHER U.S. MILITARY CONVOY WAS ATTACKED IN THE SAME AREA
BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, WITHOUT CAUSING ANY CASUALTIES BUT DAMAGING ONE
TRUCK.

   THAT ATTACK WAS ALSO CLAIMED BY THE FPM, WHICH SAID IT HAD WOUNDED SOME
AMERICANS.

   THE FPM FIRST APPEARED IN SAN PEDRO SULA IN 1979 AND HAS TAKEN CREDIT FOR
SEVERAL DYNAMITE ATTACKS AND RURAL GUERRILLA ACTIONS.

   RAMON AMAYA AMADOR, THE NAME USED BY THE HONDURAN GUERRILLA GROUP, WAS A
LEFTIST NOVELIST WHO WROTE ABOUT THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES AMONG
HONDURANS.  HE ALSO CONDEMNED FOREIGN INTERVENTION, PARTICULARLY U.S.
INTERVENTION, IN HONDURAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS.
