   SAN SALVADOR, 27 SEP 88 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN COLONEL
CIRO LOPEZ, COMMANDER OF THE "EL PARAISO" GARRISON, WHICH WAS ATTACKED
BY THE GUERRILLAS ON 13 SEPTEMBER, DENIED TODAY THAT THREE U.S.
MILITARY ADVISERS HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE CLASH WITH THE REBELS,
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE U.S. MEDIA AND PRESIDENT HAVE STATED.

   LOPEZ SAID THE "THREE ADVISERS DID NOT SHOOT, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT
ARMED AND WERE IN A PILLBOX WITH A VIEW OF THE INSIDE PART OF THE
GARRISON TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE MORTAR FIRE."

   HE ADDED THAT THE THREE ADVISERS "HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN ANY
FIGHTING" BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO HIM, "THEY WERE IN A SECURITY AREA
DURING THE TERRORIST ATTACK."

   THE INFORMATION THAT THE U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS HAD DIRECTLY
PARTICIPATED IN THE SHOOTING CAUSED BY THE GUERRILLA ATTACK WAS
CARRIED BY THE WASHINGTON POST AND CORROBORATED BY PRESIDENT REAGAN,
WHO AFFIRMED THAT THEY HAD "FIRED IN SELF-DEFENSE."

   ACCORDING TO THE REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE WASHINGTON POST, THREE
U.S.  MILITARY ADVISERS RESPONDED TO THE REBEL FIRE AGAINST THE
SALVADORAN MILITARY INSTALLATION IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRY.

   THE ARMY SUSTAINED 9 DEAD AND 12 WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE FMLN
GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE "EL PARAISO" GARRISON.

   A U.S. DIPLOMATIC SOURCE WHO CHOSE TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS STATED IN
THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL THAT "THE ADVISERS HAVE A RIGHT TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE OF SAN SALVADOR, BUT NOT TO PARTICIPATE
IN COMBAT OR ATTACK MISSIONS."

   IN HIS STATEMENTS, RONALD REAGAN SUPPORTED THE ACTION OF THE
MILITARY ADVISERS AND ADDED THAT "I HAVE NEVER SENT MY MEN TO FACE ANY
DANGER WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE CHANCE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IF THEY ARE
ATTACKED."

   IN MARCH 1987, DURING ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE GARRISON, U.S. SERGEANT
GREGORY FRONIUS, A MILITARY ADVISER, WAS KILLED.

   CURRENTLY, 55 OF THE 119 U.S. ADVISERS IN EL SALVADOR ARE MILITARY
INSTRUCTORS.
