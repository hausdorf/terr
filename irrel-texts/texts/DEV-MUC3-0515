   QUITO, 14 SEP 89 (EL COMERCIO) -- [TEXT] THE ECUADORAN POLICE DEALT
A HARSH BLOW TO DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT CAPTURED JUAN HERNANDO
GONZALEZ AND GERMAN BELANDRIA, TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO WORKED FOR THE
COLOMBIAN CARTELS.

   ACTING GOVERNMENT MINISTER LUIS FELIX LOPEZ SAID THE TWO COLOMBIANS
WERE ARRESTED IN TAISHA, IN THE CENTRAL EASTERN REGION, WHEN THEIR
AIRPLANE VIOLATED ECUADOR'S AIR SPACE.

   THE AIRPLANE, A LUXURY CESSNA 210 TWIN-MOTOR AIRCRAFT WITH A
COLOMBIAN REGISTRATION, WAS FORCED TO LAND BY THE ECUADORAN ARMED
FORCES.

   ACCORDING TO ECUADOR RADIO, THE AIRCRAFT MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING
IN THE AREA OF BUFFO IN PASTAZA PROVINCE.  THE RADIO ADDED THAT THE
AIRPLANE, NAMED CENTURION, IS WHITE AND HAS THE REGISTRATION NUMBER
H-K-27-29.

   ONCE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE ARRESTED THEY WERE BROUGHT TO QUITO
AND DEPORTED TO COLOMBIA, WHERE THEY WILL BE TRIED.

   ACTING MINISTER LOPEZ SAID THAT THE EVENT OCCURRED IN TAISHA AT
1000 ON 14 SEPTEMBER.  THE AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS FLYING OVER ECUADORAN
TERRITORY TOWARD AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION, IS NOW IN CUSTODY OF THE
ECUADORAN ARMED FORCES AT THE TAISHA AIRPORT.

   THE TWO TRAFFICKERS HAD $336,000 IN THEIR POSSESSION.

   LOPEZ SAID THAT THE ECUADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO STOP THE
INFILTRATION OF FOREIGNERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVED IN DRUG
TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES.

   THE ARREST OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS WAS COORDINATED BY THE MINISTRY
OF DEFENSE AND THE POLICE.

   GONZALEZ AND BELANDRIA ARE PRESUMABLY LINKED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING
ACTIVITIES, GIVEN THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CARRIED AND THE FACT
THAT THEY WERE CLANDESTINELY FLYING OVER ECUADORAN TERRITORY.

   IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS COVERING THE CALI-PUERTO
ASIS-LETICIA (COLOMBIA) ROUTE.
