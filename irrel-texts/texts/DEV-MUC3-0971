   CLANDESTINE, 12 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN], WITH REGARD TO THE
RESULTS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS,
REPORTS THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTS' MEETING HAS ALLOWED US TO
MEASURE THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR AND THE IMPACT OF THE
FMLN'S CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE, INASMUCH AS THE SUMMIT'S ENTIRE
EFFORT WAS AIMED AT SAVING THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FROM AN EXTREME
POLITICAL AND MILITARY CRISIS AND FROM INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION IN
EXCHANGE FOR A NEW PROMISE ON THE IMMEDIATE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS.

   2.  THE FMLN INDIGNANTLY REJECTS THE PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION
BECAUSE, CONTRARY TO THE DYNAMICS OF THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, THE CLAMOR OF DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL FORCES, AND THE CLAMOR
OF CHURCHES IN THE COUNTRY, THIS DECLARATION UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORTS
THE LEADING VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REGION, A GOVERNMENT THAT
HAS MURDERED AND PERSECUTED THE CLERGY AND BOMBED THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION. THIS SUPPORT ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO HAVE UNLEASHED THAT
IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE AND ALLOWS MORE MURDERS IN EL SALVADOR.

   3.  THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A NEGOTIATED
SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR. THE FMLN CANNOT BE DISBANDED AS THE RESULT OF
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THE FMLN CONSTITUTES A
GENUINELY POPULAR POWER THROUGHOUT THE SALVADORAN TERRITORY, A FORCE
THAT THE HUGE U.S.-FINANCED WAR MACHINE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP IN
10 YEARS.

   4. AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID IN PRIVATE, THE FMLN AGREES WITH UN
SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ' MEDIATION TO INITIATE SERIOUS
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
AND SOCIAL FORCES.

   5. WE ARE HEREBY CALLING FOR INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY SO OTHER
COUNTRIES CAN MOBILIZE IMMEDIATELY TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE,
WHO ARE IN DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM AN ESCALATION IN EFFORTS TO
EXTERMINATE IT BECAUSE THE FASCIST POLICY HAS BEEN REINFORCED BY THE
SUPPORT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION OFFERS TO
CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.

   EL SALVADOR, 12 DECEMBER 1989.
