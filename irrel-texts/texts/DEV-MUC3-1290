   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 16 MAY 90 (EL PANAMA AMERICA) -- [ARTICLE]
[CARLOS VARGAS] [TEXT] THE PRESUMED SUBVERSIVE GROUP M-20 [20 DECEMBER
MOVEMENT] THREATENED ON 15 MAY TO ENTER THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY AND FREE
THE REFUGEES THERE.  IT ALSO CALLED SEVERAL MEDIA CLAIMING THAT IT HAD
KIDNAPPED A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND PLACED BOMBS IN SEVERAL GOVERNMENT
OFFICES.

   IN VIEW OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS, THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH FOREIGN
MINISTER JULIO LINARES, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS STRENGTHENED POLICE
PROTECTION AROUND THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN THIS CAPITAL.

   FORMER PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS GONZALO GONZALEZ AND
HERACLIDES SUCRE, CLOSE COLLABORATORS OF OVERTHROWN GENERAL MANUEL
NORIEGA, ARE REFUGEES AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY.  GONZALEZ IS ALLEGEDLY
INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS WHO TRIED
UNSUCCESSFULLY TO OVERTHROW NORIEGA ON 3 OCTOBER 1989.  FOREIGN
MINISTER LINARES REVEALED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY HAD RECEIVED TWO
TELEPHONE CALLS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS M-20
MEMBERS AND THREATENED TO ENTER THE EMBASSY GROUNDS TO FREE THE
REFUGEES THERE.

   SECURITY AROUND THE EMBASSY WAS REINFORCED, ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN
STRENGTHENED EARLIER AFTER SEVERAL OFFICERS OF THE FORMER REGIME
SOUGHT ASYLUM THERE.

   MEANWHILE, THE DIRECTOR OF THE "INSTITUTO AMERICA" HIGH SCHOOL
DENIED THE M-20'S CLAIM THAT IT WAS HOLDING, AND THREATENED TO KILL, A
STUDENT FROM THAT SCHOOL.

   ALSO ON 15 MAY, PANAMANIAN AND AMERICAN POLICEMEN HAD TO ORDER THE
EVACUATION OF WORKERS FROM SEVERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN THE BANKING
AREA OF VIA ESPANA DUE TO REPORTED BOMB THREATS FROM THE M- 20.

   THE M-20 ALLEGEDLY IS A GROUP OF SUPPORTERS OF OVERTHROWN GENERAL
NORIEGA WHO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MARCH TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE
"MY PLACE" BAR.  ONE U.S. SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND 20 PANAMANIANS WERE
WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK.

   FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES SAID THAT HE COULD NOT CONFIRM THE
EXISTENCE OF THE M-20.

   A NUMBER OF DAYS AGO THE SOUTHERN COMMAND OFFERED A $10,000 REWARD
TO ANY PERSON WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION LEADING TO THE ARREST OF THE
MAN WHO THREW THE BOMB INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED BAR.

   IT WAS ALSO LEARNED THAT THE JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE ARE TRYING
TO TRACE THE TELEPHONE CALLS, WHICH HAVE SCARED THE CITIZENS SOMEWHAT.

   MAJOR GONZALO GONZALEZ, WHO HAS TAKEN REFUGE AT THE PERUVIAN
EMBASSY, WAS ALSO ACCUSED OF BEING THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE DEATH OF
YOUNG MELQUIADES RODRIGUEZ JUSTINE, A GRANDSON OF FORMER COLONEL
JUSTINE.
