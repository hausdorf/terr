[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] FORCES ATTACKED A GROUP OF
PARATROOPERS AT THE INSA [EXPANSION UNKNOWN] FACTORY IN SOYAPANGO.
THE REPORT ALSO ADDS THAT SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING, FIGHTING HAS BEEN
GOING ON IN GUADALUPE NEIGHBORHOOD, ALSO IN SOYAPANGO.  REPORTS FROM
OTHER AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR SPEAK OF HEAVY CLASHES SINCE EARLY THIS
MORNING.  THE REPORT STATES THAT AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN UNITS ATTACKED
TWO 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COBRA BATTALION COMPANIES IN SAN SALVADOR.
THE TROOPS WERE IN EL CARMEN HILL, AYUTUXTEPEQUE JURISDICTION.  THE
REPORT ADDS THAT THE FMLN INFLICTED TWO DEAD AND THREE WOUNDED,
INCLUDING A SERGEANT AND A CORPORAL.  THIS MEANS THAT THE 4TH INFANTRY
BRIGADE IS ALREADY IN SAN SALVADOR.  THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE IN SAN
SALVADOR: SONSONATE TROOPS, 5TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, AND 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS ARE IN SAN SALVADOR.  THIS IS PROOF OF HOW BAD
THE ENEMY IS DOING.

   THE REPORT ADDS THAT SINCE THIS MORNING, FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL
BATTALION TROOPS WAS REPORTED IN THE AREA AROUND EL CARMEN HILL.  THE
ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS WERE GOING TO REINFORCE THE COWARDLY 4TH
INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, WHO HAVE LEFT CHALATENANGO AND ARE NOW IN SAN
SALVADOR.  THE FIGHTING ENDED AT 0930 [1530 GMT].

   WE REPEAT: AT 0200 TODAY, FMLN UNITS ATTACKED A GROUP OF
PARATROOPERS AT THE INSA FACTORY IN SOYAPANGO.  FIGHTING WAS ALSO
REPORTED IN SAN JACINTO, MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, SOYAPANGO, SANTA
EDUVIGES, ESCANDIA NEIGHBORHOOD, EL CARMEN NEIGHBORHOOD, AND OTHER
AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR.  WE ARE WAITING FOR MORE REPORTS BECAUSE WE
HAVE LEARNED THAT FIGHTING HAS RESUMED IN THE CAPITAL CITY.

   TO ADD TO THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WE WISH TO
STATE THAT HEAVY FIGHTING OCCURRED THIS MORNING IN GUADALUPE
NEIGHBORHOOD, SOYAPANGO.  AT 0600 [1200 GMT], NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS
