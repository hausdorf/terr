   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 25 JUN 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS WARNED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS
PRESSURING THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA
TO INCREASE ITS "AGGRESSIVE" ACTIONS AGAINST THE SANDINISTS.

   DURING A MEETING WITH INDUSTRIALISTS IN MASAYA, 35 KM SOUTH OF MANAGUA,
ORTEGA SOUNDED IRRITATED IN LIGHT OF THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT'S THREATS TO
BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.

   ON SATURDAY, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE TO PROTEST
STATEMENTS BY NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D' ESCOTO AGAINST HONDURAN
PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA, WHOM D' ESCOTO ACCUSED OF HAVING IMPLEMENTED A
"NARCOSTATE".

   ORTEGA SAID:  "WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HONDURAS FEELS OFFENDED WHEN WE
ARE THE ONES WHO WERE OFFENDED, NOT THEM."

   "WE COULD HAVE BROKEN RELATIONS WITH THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT A LONG TIME
AGO, FROM THE MOMENT HONDURAS WAS FIRST USED AS A SPRINGBOARD TO ATTACK
NICARAGUA," THE SANDINIST LEADER STRESSED.

   THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTRY YESTERDAY WARNED, IN A VEILED MANNER, THAT
NICARAGUA BECAUSE OF WHAT IT DESCRIBED AS " D' ESCOTO'S DIRTY REMARKS."'

   HONDURAS "HAS REACTED WITH JUSTIFIED INDIGNATION, TO THE POINT OF
REQUESTING A BREAK IN RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA," THE HONDURAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY ADDED.  

   D' ESCOTO, WHO IS CURRENTLY IN VENEZUELA, CRITICIZED HONDURAS' POLICY AND
SAID THAT HONDURAS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE COUNTRY TO HOLD THE NEXT CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   THE HEAD OF NICARAGUA SAID THAT THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES "HAVE OFFENDED
THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WITH THEIR WORDS AND ACTIONS, AND THEY HAVE SERVED AS
A SPRINGBOARD FOR THE MURDER OF CHILDREN AND THE MUTILATION OF THE
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE."

   ORTEGA ALSO CRITICIZED U.S. VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE'S VISIT TO
TEGUCIGALPA AND SAID THAT THOSE MEETINGS IN WHICH NICARAGUA WAS ATTACKED
"MUST BE DENOUNCED."
