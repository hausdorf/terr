   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
THE FIGHTING IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS BRINGS UP
SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM AND CONTENT OF THE WAR IN EL
SALVADOR WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE
POOR AND WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE
RICH.  TODAY, WHEN THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
CAPITAL CITY, INCLUDING PLACES SUCH AS THE ESCALON, SAN BENITO, SAN
FRANCISCO, AND GENERAL ARCE RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE U.S.  DIPLOMATIC
PERSONNEL LIVE, WHERE THE MILITARY OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
HAVE THEIR RESIDENCES, WHERE THE SALVADORAN HIGH SOCIETY HAS ITS
RESIDENCES, THEN THE REPERCUSSIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

   U.S. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN REACTED QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DELAY.
MARLIN FITZWATER, JAMES BAKER, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AMBASSADOR
WALKER, EVERYONE WAS VERY WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF U.S. PERSONNEL.
THEY EXPRESSED ANGRY WORDS AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE WORLD THAT IS
WELL INFORMED OF THE WAR SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, IT IS PRECISELY THE
PENTAGON, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE THEY
HAVE FINANCED AND GIVEN ADVICE TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   IT IS NOT OUR PRESENCE IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT
JEOPARDIZES U.S. PERSONNEL.  ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE U.S.
PRESENCE, THE U.S. MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR THAT IS JEOPARDIZING ITS
STAFF.  THEY CANNOT ASK US TO GET OUT OF SAN SALVADOR SO THAT THE
AMERICANS WILL NOT BE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE.  IT IS THE U.S.
INTERVENTION IN THE COUNTRY THAT MUST COME TO AN END, SO THAT WE
SALVADORANS WILL BE ABLE TO SETTLE OUR PROBLEMS AMONG OURSELVES.  THIS
IS OUR LAND, OUR FATHERLAND.

   THE WAR WAS IMPOSED BY THE INJUSTICES, THE SLAUGHTERS, THE
DICTATORSHIPS, AND TO A GREAT EXTENT, BY THE AMERICANS WHO SPEND $1.4
MILLION DAILY IN THIS WAR.  THIS IS A CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR EL SALVADOR.
THAT IS WHY WE DEMAND THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, THAT IS, THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, THE U.S. CONGRESS, AND THE U.S. PEOPLE CAREFULLY THINK
THIS OVER AND ACT SENSIBLY SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT AN END TO
THIS WAR.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT -- THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION -- THINK THIS OVER AND PROMOTE CHANGES IN ITS POLICY
TOWARD EL SALVADOR, AND THUS MAKE FEASIBLE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.

   WE HAVE PUBLICLY AND OFFICIALLY SAID, AS ONE OF OUR MANY GESTURES
OF GOOD WILL, THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT ATTACK U.S. DIPLOMATIC
INSTALLATIONS OR PERSONNEL IN EL SALVADOR.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE
INSTRUCTED OUR UNITS, OUR FIGHTERS, AND COMMANDO GROUPS NOT TO ATTACK
DIPLOMATIC SITES, BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS FOR
THE FMLN.  WE HOPE THAT IN THE SAME MANNER, BOTH THE U.S. EMBASSY AS
WELL AS THE OTHER DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WILL INSTRUCT THEIR
SECURITY GUARDS SO THEY WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THUS
PREVENTING CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD ALL REGRET.

   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN DEFINING THE
CONFLICT.  THE U.S. CONGRESS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,
SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, ARE ALREADY DISCUSSING THE
TRUE SITUATION OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOMENT TO
CHANGE POLICIES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTINUE TO FINANCE AND
SUPPORT A REGIME WHICH IS BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE         
CITIES, A REGIME WHICH MURDERS PRIESTS, WHICH PUBLICLY THREATENS THE     
BISHOPS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST USE ITS GOOD JUDGMENT AND
CONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF THE WAR, AND NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A
FASCIST REGIME THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OUR FATHERLAND, EL
SALVADOR.
