   SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] PRESIDENT
DUARTE SAID THIS AFTERNOON THAT PRESIDENT- ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S
PEACE PROPOSAL DESERVES RESPECT AND THAT ONE MUST HOPE THAT IT WILL
PRODUCE RESULTS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE
PRESIDENT MADE THIS STATEMENT AT COMALPA AIRPORT UPON HIS RETURN FROM
THE UNITED STATES.  HE ADDED THAT HE WILL RESUME HIS DUTIES TOMORROW,
EVEN THOUGH HIS CANCER HAS GROWN.  THERE HAS BEEN VERY NEGATIVE
SPECULATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH, BUT HE STATED THAT HE WILL
RESUME HIS DUTIES IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] THE TESTS I UNDERWENT INDICATE THAT THE LIVER
CANCER HAS GROWN.  IT HAS NOT SPREAD BUT IT HAS GROWN, WHICH ADDS TO THE
RISK.  I UNDERWENT A 5-DAY TREATMENT, AND I WILL HAVE TO RETURN AS SOON AS I
PASS THE PRESIDENCY ON TO MY SUCCESSOR.  I WILL RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL ON 2
JUNE FOR ANOTHER CHECKUP AND TREATMENT.

   [REPORTER] WHEN WILL YOU RESUME YOUR DUTIES?  

   [DUARTE] IMMEDIATELY.  I AM THE PRESIDENT AND AS SOON AS I SET FOOT ON
SALVADORAN SOIL, I RESUME MY DUTIES. [END RECORDING] 

   IN REGARD TO THE SEARCHES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AT VARIOUS UNION
HEADQUARTERS, DUARTE SAID HE WAS NOT FULLY AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN
WHICH THESE WERE CARRIED OUT.  HOWEVER, HE SAID THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS MUST
BE DEFENDED WHEN DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS TURN INTO LIBERTINISM.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] ONE MUST NOT CONFUSE THE FREEDOM OF ALL
SALVADORANS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES, HOLD DEMONSTRATIONS, JOIN UNIONS, AND
WORK FOR THEIR ASPIRATIONS WITH TERRORIST AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THAT ATTACK
DEMOCRACY.  ONE MUST NOT CONFUSE THESE THINGS.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BASIC
POINTS I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE ALL SECTORS UNDERSTAND.  I HAVE BEEN CREATING
POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY SO THAT GRADUALLY WE WILL LEARN TO
LIVE FREELY IN A DEMOCRACY WHILE RESPECTING ONE ANOTHER. [END RECORDING]

   ASKED ABOUT THE UNITED FRONT THAT ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]
IS PROMOTING IN THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IF THIS
BENEFITS THE COUNTRY, IT DESERVES SUPPORT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A POLICY FOR PEACE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT -- IN OTHER WORDS, BY ME. I
HAVE PUBLICLY STATED THIS, AND I HAVE TRIED TO ACHIEVE PEACE THROUGH [WORDS
INDISTINCT].  IT WILL NOW BE UP TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT.  I HAVE TO SHOW
RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT CRISTIANI, WHO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO
BEGIN HIS TERM IN AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH HE CAN PRESENT HIS IDEAS,
PROPOSALS, AND SOLUTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO FIND THE PATH TO PEACE. [END
RECORDING]

   PRESIDENT DUARTE DID NOT COMMENT ON THE PEACE PROPOSAL THAT WAS RECENTLY
ANNOUNCED BY ARENA BECAUSE, HE SAID, HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT, ADDING
THAT IT WOULD BE UNETHICAL TO QUESTION THE PROPOSALS AND EFFORTS OF THE NEXT
PRESIDENT.  HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT ANY EFFORTS FOR PEACE MUST BE SUPPORTED.
