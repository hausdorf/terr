   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH SALVADOR
SAMAYOA, MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION OF THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY
FRONT, FMLN-FDR, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]
[SAMAYOA] THEREFORE, THE WESTERN EUROPEAN PRESS, POLITICAL PARTIES,
LABOR UNIONS, AND GENERAL PUBLIC ARE VERY STRONGLY REJECTING
CRISTIANI'S REGIME.  THE CONGRESSES AND PARLIAMENTS OF MANY WESTERN
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE SAYING THAT THE COOPERATION THE SALVADORAN
REGIME RECEIVES SHOULD BE REEVALUATED.

   [REPORTER] COMRADE SALVADOR SAMAYOA, THE GOVERNMENT NETWORK IS
REPORTING THAT U.S. AID TO CRISTIANI WILL CONTINUE.  THE COLONELS HAVE
ALSO SAID THAT THE FMLN CANNOT DEFEAT THE ARMED FORCES BECAUSE THE
LATTER HAS MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
RETURNING TO THIS POINT, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?  WHAT
OPTIONS DOES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE CONCERNING EL SALVADOR, AND WHAT
IMPACT HAS THE NEW SITUATION HAD ON U.S. POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR?

   [SAMAYOA] AS I SAID, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THAT A NEW INTERNAL SITUATION OF GENERALIZED POPULAR,
POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DISCONTENT IS TAKING SHAPE, AND THAT FROM THIS
MOMENT ON ITS POLICY IN EL SALVADOR WILL UNDERGO ISOLATION AND WILL BE
REJECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND EVEN BY VERY IMPORTANT SECTORS
WITHIN THE HOUSE AND SENATE.

   SO FAR, THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS STUBBORNLY CONTINUED PROVIDING
AID AND SUPPORT TO A REGIME THAT IS OBVIOUSLY CRIMINAL AND GENOCIDAL,
AND THAT POLICY IS [WORDS INDISTINCT] CURRENTLY A VERY STRONG DEBATE
IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT
ARE TO SINK WITH THE CRISTIANI REGIME, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MOVING
TOWARD DEFEAT AND MILITARY AND POLITICAL DESTRUCTION DESPITE ALL THE
PROPAGANDA IT HAS MADE, OR TO CHANGE ITS OPINION WHILE THERE IS STILL
TIME.  THE ALTERNATIVE OF A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT, A REPLACEMENT OF
CRISTIANI'S REGIME OR THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, IS ALREADY UNDER
DISCUSSION.  THESE, THEREFORE, ARE THE TWO ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO
THE UNITED STATES: EITHER CHANGE ITS POLICY IN TIME AND REPLACE
CRISTIANI, OR THE GOVERNMENT WILL SINK BECAUSE ITS PROPAGANDA IS NOT
WORKING.

   THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HAS MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF.  HE SAID THE
GUERRILLAS HAD 1,500 MEN IN SAN SALVADOR, AND HE HAS LISTED CASUALTY
FIGURES ACCORDING TO WHICH THE FMLN SUFFERED OVER 500 DEATHS, OVER 400
WOUNDED, AND OTHERS CAPTURED.  ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES QUOTED BY THE
U.S. AMBASSADOR, WHO PROVIDES GOVERNMENT WAR BULLETINS AND HAS ALMOST
BECOME THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER, THE FMLN ONLY HAS 200 MEN LEFT
IN SAN SALVADOR.

   WHAT I FIND INEXPLICABLE IS THE GOVERNMENT'S NEED TO USE 40 OR 50
WAR PLANES AND HELICOPTERS, ALONG WITH ITS ARTILLERY AND ELITE
BATTALIONS, TO BOMB AND DESTROY CITIES, ESPECIALLY SAN SALVADOR.  THAT
IS WHY THEIR PROPAGANDA HAS BACKFIRED ON THEM.  IN THE UNITED STATES
THE PRESS AND GENERAL PUBLIC KNOW FULL WELL THAT THE FMLN OFFENSIVE IS
IN FULL FORCE AND IS MOVING FORWARD, AND THAT THE U.S.  POLICY IS
REACHING THE POINT OF TOTAL FAILURE.

   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMRADE SAMAYOA, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE ON
RADIO VENCEREMOS TO THE COMRADES WHO HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR POSITIONS
IN SAN SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND VARIOUS
POINTS OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY?  WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE
FIGHTERS AND THE PEOPLE?

   [SAMAYOA] TO ALL THE COMRADES WHO ARE FIGHTING IN TRENCHES
THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF OUR COUNTRY, I MUST SAY THAT THE
AFFECTION AND ADMIRATION YOU HAVE GENERATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THE
SOLIDARITY WITH YOUR STRUGGLE, AND THE SURPRISING STRENGTH AND HEROISM
YOU HAVE DISPLAYED ARE NOW RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM ALMOST ALL OF THE
COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.  THEREFORE, OUR STRUGGLE NOT ONLY IS NOT
ALONE, BUT IT HAS NOW ACHIEVED MAXIMUM SUPPORT OF ALL TYPES:
POLITICAL, MATERIAL, ECONOMIC.  SOLIDARITY HAS MULTIPLIED HUNDREDFOLD
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, AND IT WILL BE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF
SUPPORT THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO COMPLETING THE FASCIST REGIME'S
DESTRUCTION.  THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ADMIRE THE STRUGGLE THE COMRADES
AND FIGHTERS IN ALL THE CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE WAGING, AND THEY
VERY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE IS FOR A JUST CAUSE AND
AGAINST A COMPLETELY ILLEGITIMATE, FASCIST, AND CRIMINAL REGIME.

   THE COMRADES CAN REST ASSURED OF THIS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, WHICH
IS CURRENTLY VERY GREAT.  IT IS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE ALL OF THE AFFECTION
AND ADMIRATION THAT OUR FIGHTERS ARE RECEIVING FROM ALL OVER THE
WORLD.

   [REPORTER] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SALVADOR.  OUR GREETINGS TO ALL THE
OTHER COMRADES.

   [SAMAYOA] THANK YOU, [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
