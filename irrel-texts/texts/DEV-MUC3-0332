   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 6 AUG 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT]
PRESIDENT MANUEL SOLIS PALMA HAS SAID IN LA PAZ, BOLIVIA THAT PANAMA
IS LIKE A COUNTRY BEING INVADED WITHOUT A SHOT BEING FIRED.  THAT IS
HOW THE PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE PERMANENT U.S. INVASION ON
PANAMANIAN TERRITORY.  HE SAID THAT U.S. SOLDIERS PERMANENTLY VIOLATE
THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES AND FREQUENTLY OCCUPY UNAUTHORIZED ZONES
WITH TANKS AND SOLDIERS.

   SOLIS PALMA ALSO SAID PANAMA HAS AVOIDED PROVOCATIONS SO THAT THE
INVADERS CANNOT JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS, BUT IN CASE OF A CONFRONTATION, THE
PEOPLE AND THE PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES ARE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY.

   AS FOR PANAMA'S INTERNAL SITUATION, SOLIS PALMA SAID HIS GOVERNMENT IS
DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND OTHER SOCIAL
AND POLITICAL GROUPS SO THAT A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT CAN BE CREATED
BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE CANAL BELONGS TO PANAMA AND NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT BE VIOLATED.
