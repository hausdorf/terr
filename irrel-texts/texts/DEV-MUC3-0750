   HAVANA (CUBA), 15 NOV 89 (TELE-REBELDE NETWORK) -- [EXCERPTS]
COMMANDER IN CHIEF FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
OF CUBA AND PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCILS OF STATE AND MINISTERS, LAST NIGHT
GRANTED AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW TO OUR REPORTER, OSCAR SUAREZ, AT THE
INAUGURATION OF THE MADRID RESTAURANT IN HABANA VIEJA. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CASTRO] TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT DAY.  TODAY, WHEN
WE ARE COMMEMORATING THE 470TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAVANA, WE RECEIVED THE
NEWS OF THE CRUSHING TRIUMPH OF THE SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE'S
ORGANIZATION IN THE NAMIBIAN ELECTIONS BY 57 PERCENT. IT IS A VERY
GOOD PERCENTAGE.

   ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO RECEIVED THE NEWS....[REPHRASES] WE
ADMIRE THE HEROISM WITH WHICH THE SALVADORANS ARE FIGHTING.  IT IS
SOMETHING VERY IMPRESSIVE.  IT IS A LIKE A LESSON TO IMPERIALISM WHICH
IS EUPHORIC AND THINKS THAT THE WORLD IS AT ITS FEET. THEY THINK
THAT...

   [SUAREZ, INTERRUPTING] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHICH IS TERRIBLE.

   [CASTRO] I BELIEVE THE ACTIONS THAT THE SALVADORANS ARE PRESENTLY
CARRYING OUT ARE ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATS THAT HAVE EVER
BEEN WRITTEN.  DESPITE THE 10 YEARS [OF STRUGGLE], THE
BILLIONS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS INVESTED IN CREATING THE
SALVADORAN ARMY AND SUPPLYING IT WITH THE MOST MODERN TYPES OF ARMS,
NOTICE HOW THOSE PEOPLE CAN FIGHT.  NOTICE WHAT IS BEING DONE.  HOW
ARE THEY USING THE YANKEE BOMBS AND PLANES?  THEY ARE BEING USED TO
MASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  JUST NOTICE HOW THEY ARE
INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH ARE IN THE
HANDS OF THE REVOLUTIONARIES.  WHAT THE IMPERIALISTS ARE DOING IS
SOMETHING REPUGNANT.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT WHAT THE SALVADORANS ARE
DOING IS AMAZING, ADMIRABLE.  WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS SHOWING THE
IMPERIALISTS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FAR FROM KNEELING BEFORE THEM.  THEIR
ACTIONS ARE SHOWING IMPERIALISM THAT THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING
WITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE EUPHORIA THAT CURRENTLY OVERCOMES THEM UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

   [SUAREZ] COMMANDER, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF WHY WE
HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS?  WE, THE CUBANS ARE WHAT WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE A
MIXTURE OF SPANISH AND AFRICAN.

   [CASTRO] I THINK WE HAVE THE FRIENDS WE DO BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLLOWED
A POLICY OF PRINCIPLE.  I THINK THE FRIENDS WE HAVE ARE BASICALLY DUE
TO THE PRESTIGE OF THE REVOLUTION, THE RESPECT THE REVOLUTION MERITS,
THE ETHICS OF THE REVOLUTION, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION.
NOW, THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALSO A MIXTURE OF CARIBBEANS, THAT IS
SOMETHING ELSE.  THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS.  [WORD
INDISTINCT] REASONS WE CAN HAVE CONGENIALITY.  HOWEVER, CONGENIALITY
DOES NOT ALWAYS TURN INTO TRUE FRIENDSHIP.  THERE COULD BE
CONGENIALITY BUT IT DOES NOT RESULT IN FRIENDSHIP.  FRIENDSHIP IS MORE
A RESULT OF RECOGNITION, ADMIRATION FOR A COUNTRY.

   [SUREZ] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT...

   [CASTRO] THIS SMALL COUNTRY WAS FACING THE EMPIRE, IT BECAME A
BASTION OF DIGNITY FOR THE WORLD.  I THINK THIS MERITS CERTAIN
RECOGNITION AND LIKING. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT AND OF THE FRIENDS WE
HAVE.  I APPRECIATE THESE FRIENDS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE
YANKEE PRESSURES.  THEY ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE YANKEE THREATS,
INTRIGUES, AND CAMPAIGNS.  THIS SAYS A LOT.  THE YANKEES WANTED TO
BURY AND DISCREDIT THE REVOLUTION WITH THE MEDIA AGENCIES THEY OWN.
HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT.  THAT IS WHY UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY
THAT OTHER NATIONS RENDER US.  ASIDE, FROM THAT, WE ARE CARIBBEANS.
WE ARE A GOOD MIXTURE.  WE ARE A MIXTURE OF WHICH WE ARE PROUD.  WE
ARE A MIXTURE OF INDIAN, AFRICAN, AND EUROPEAN.  THAT MIXTURE HAS
TURNED OUT TO BE VERY GOOD.

   [SUAREZ] WE ALSO HAVE CHINESE MIXTURE IN US.

   [CASTRO] THAT IS TRUE, YOU ARE CORRECT IN REMINDING US OF IT.  I
THINK THIS MIXTURE HAS ALSO HELPED TO ENRICH THE VIRTUES OF OUR
NATION. [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] [END RECORDING]
