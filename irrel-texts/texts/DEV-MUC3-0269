   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 28 JUN 89 (BARRICADA) -- [TEXT] A
PROPAGANDISTIC SCANDAL WAS PROMOTED IN HONDURAS YESTERDAY, WITH THE
REPORT THAT AN ALLEGED NICARAGUAN SPY, WHO HAD SURRENDERED TO HONDURAN
AUTHORITIES, "HAD THE MISSION OF ASSASSINATING PRESIDENT AZCONA,
ARCHBISHOP SANTOS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, AND HONDURAN OPPOSITION
LEADERS."

   HONDURAN MEDIA IDENTIFIED THE ALLEGED DEFECTOR AS ORLANDO SOLORZANO
MARTINEZ, WHOM THEY CLAIMED WAS TRAINED IN CUBA.

   REGARDING THIS CASE, IT IS RECALLED THAT AT OTHER TIMES IN HONDURAS,
ALLEGED NICARAGUAN MILITARY DEFECTORS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO MAKE CHARGES
AGAINST THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT.  IN MOST CASES, SUCH CITIZENS DID NOT
EXIST UNDER THE NAMES CITED OR SIMPLY WERE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE NICARAGUAN
ARMED FORCES.

   AS IS KNOWN, HONDURAN PRESIDENT AZCONA HOYO'S GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY
USED THE PRETEXT OF NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER D'ESCOTO'S STATEMENTS IN
CARACAS TO THREATEN TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.
