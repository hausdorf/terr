DEV-MUC3-1098 (UNISYS)

   BOGOTA, 11 FEB 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO VARGAS SAID HE WILL ASK U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH -- DURING THE
15 FEBRUARY DRUG SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN CARTAGENA -- FOR GREATER
ASSISTANCE TO BOLIVIA AND PERU, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PRODUCERS OF COCA
LEAVES.

   DURING AN INFORMAL TALK WITH NEWSMEN, BARCO SAID THAT AT THE SUMMIT
HE WILL ASK PRESIDENT BUSH TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE
TO FIGHT THE "WAR" HE HIMSELF DECLARED ON DRUG- TRAFFICKING MAFIAS
AFTER VARIOUS TERRORIST ACTIONS LAST AUGUST.

   ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SPECIFY THE KIND OF AID OR HOW IT SHOULD BE
PROVIDED, BARCO VARGAS SAID THE ECONOMIC MEASURES HE WILL ASK FOR
WOULD CONCENTRATE ON A GREATER OPENING OF THE U.S. MARKET TO EXPORTS
FROM ANDEAN COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY PRODUCTION AND CHEMICAL PROCESSING
OF COCAINE.

   IN ADDITION TO PRESIDENTS BUSH AND BARCO, BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME
PAZ ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL ALSO ATTEND THE
SUMMIT.  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PRESENT PROPOSALS ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF
OTHER CROPS FOR COCA LEAVES -- THE BASE FOR MAKING COCAINE -- WHILE
BEARING IN MIND THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF
PEASANTS ENGAGED IN THIS ACTIVITY.

   THE FOUR PRESIDENTS WILL MEET FOR NO LONGER THAN FIVE HOURS AND
WILL SIGN A DOCUMENT IN WHICH THEY WILL DEFINE STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP
AN OVERALL STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL REPORTS, THE POINTS THAT WILL BE INCLUDED
IN THE JOINT DOCUMENT INCLUDE STRENGTHENING ANDEAN ECONOMIES BY
INCREASING EXPORTS, AND THE "TOTAL STRUGGLE" AGAINST INTERNATIONAL
DRUG-TRAFFICKING GANGS BY REDUCING DEMAND, CONSUMPTION, AND SUPPLY OF
HALLUCINOGENIC DRUGS.

   BARCO VARGAS SAID INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS SHOULD "ESPECIALLY HELP
THE FRATERNAL COUNTRIES OF BOLIVIA AND PERU, WHICH HAVE GREAT NEEDS."

   ONE OF THE COLOMBIAN OBJECTIVES AT THE ANTIDRUG SUMMIT WILL BE TO
MAKE THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTAND ITS CORESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SERIOUS
COCAINE-TRAFFICKING PROBLEM BECAUSE OF ITS ALMOST 14.5 MILLION DRUG
ADDICTS AND BECAUSE OF ITS SALES OF WEAPONS AND CHEMICAL COMPONENTS --
WHICH SEEM TO HAVE NO OFFICIAL CONTROL -- TO MAFIAS.

   AT LEAST 5,000 MEN FROM COLOMBIAN SECURITY CORPS ARE ALREADY
PATROLLING STRATEGIC SITES IN CARTAGENA TO PREVENT ANY ACT OF
TERRORISM THAT COULD BE PERPETRATED BY THE DRUG CARTELS DURING THE
SUMMIT.
