   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MODERATOR AND REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] MARIA DE DOLORES ARJAC.

   [ARJAC] IT IS SAID THAT AID TO EL SALVADOR WAS STOPPED [WORD
INDISTINCT] FOR AID TO PANAMA. COULD IT NOT HAPPEN -- WITH MRS.
CHAMORRA'S VICTORY -- THAT READJUSTMENTS ARE MADE IN AID TO SEVERAL
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING EL SALVADOR?  IN THIS RESPECT,
THE FRG GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY RENEWED AID TO EL SALVADOR, BUT NOT TO
OTHER COUNTRIES.  HOW DO YOU SEE THIS SITUATION?

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, THIS COULD WELL HAPPEN, AS, OBVIOUSLY, THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AND THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ARE FREE TO
GIVE AID TO WHATEVER COUNTRY THEY BELIEVE IT IS ADVISABLE TO DO SO.
CERTAINLY THERE IS A NEW SITUATION, AND MANY HAVE EXPRESSED TODAY THAT
THEY ARE WILLING TO HELP NICARAGUA, AS WELL AS PANAMA AND OTHERS.
THIS SITUATION COULD PERFECTLY WELL LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF AID TO EL
SALVADOR.  THIS IS A POSSIBILITY.

   [MODERATOR] JUAN BURGOS OF INTERPRESS SERVICE.

   [BURGOS] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] UN SECRETARY GENERAL THAT ARE
INTERPRETED AS THAT PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO YOU AND TO THE ARMED
FORCES COMMANDERS BY SOME POLITICAL LEADERS.

   [CRISTIANI] I CAN TELL YOU VERY CLEARLY, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL CAN TESTIFY TO MY STATEMENTS, THAT OUR POSITION HAS
BEEN FITTING AND CONSISTENT AND THAT WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE
EXPRESSED TO HIM AT PRESENT.  WE DID PLACE AS A PRE-CONDITION THAT THE
FMLN STOP ALL TERRORIST ACTIONS.  IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
UNITED NATIONS, AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS CONDEMNED TERRORISM, CANNOT
BACK OUR POSITION, AS WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE FMLN TERRORIST
ACTIONS.  BUT WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR POSITION, AND IT IS THE SAME ONE
WE EXPRESSED TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL.

   [MODERATOR) MARGARITA ARTEGA OF ACAN-EFE.

   [ARTEAGA] MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF THE
MOBILIZATION OF PEASANTS TODAY [WORDS INDISTINCT] COULD BE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE STATE OF SIEGE IS ABOUT TO LIFTED, AS,
SUPPOSEDLY, CONCENTRATIONS AND MOBILIZATIONS ARE PROHIBITED?

   [CRISTIANI] IT DEPENDS ON THE SECURITY SITUATION.  THE STATE OF
SIEGE IS NOT PERMANENT.  WE MUST ANALYZE THE CONTEXT OF THE THREAT
THAT MIGHT EXIST WITH REGARD TO SECURITY.  WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS,
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET CONFIRMED THEM, CLAIMING THAT THE FMLN HAS SAID
THAT IT DOES NOT INTEND TO LAUNCH ANY MORE OFFENSIVES.  IT IS A GOOD
SIGN THAT THE FMLN IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO A DIALOGUE, AND THIS COULD
PRODUCE THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE.  AS YOU KNOW, THE STATE OF
SIEGE HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED.  IT IS NOT THE SAME.  WE HAVE BEEN
REDUCING IT PROGRESSIVELY AND IT IS NOW STRICTLY WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR
NATIONAL SECURITY.

   [MODERATOR] FRANCISCO ESPINOSA FOR ABC NEWS.

   [ESPINOZA] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT]

   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I DO NOT KNOW.  I BELIEVE THAT FOR A DIALOGUE TO
TAKE PLACE, THE PRE-CONDITION HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF NICARGUAN
ELECTION RESULTS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FMLN.  OUR POSITION IS
BASED ON PRINCIPLES, ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PEOPLE NOT CONTINUE TO
SUFFER THE VIOLENCE GENERATED BY FMLN TERRORISM.  THUS, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF THE ELECTIONS.  OBVIOUSLY,
I BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS WILL AFFECT THE FMLN
IN SOME MEASURES, AND THIS COULD INCLUDE... [CHANGES THOUGHT] I DO NOT
KNOW.  WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE WHAT POSITION THEY WILL TAKE IN THE
FUTURE, BUT IT COULD BE.  OBVIOUSLY A CHANGE HAS OCCURRED AND WILL
HAVE AN IMPACT AND COULD MOVE THE FMLN TO CHANGE ITS POSITION.  [CONTINUED]
