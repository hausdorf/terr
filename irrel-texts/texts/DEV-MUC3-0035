   SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE NEW FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] PROPOSAL TO STOP FIGHTING PROVIDED THE U.S. CONGRESS
SUSPENDS AID TO EL SALVADOR IS BLACKMAIL.  WITH THIS, HE SAID, THE FMLN IS
SHOWING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT ITS MEMBERS ARE PLAIN TERRORISTS.

   THIS WAS SAID ON 12 JANUARY BY THE RULING NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
PRESIDENT DR ARMANDO CALDERON SOL, WHO MAINTAINED THAT ASPIRATIONS OF THE
SUBSERSIVES ARE "DETESTABLE," AND, THEREFORE, CANNOT BE ACCEPTED.

   THE PROMINENT POLITICAL LEADER SAID THAT WHILE IN EAST EUROPE THERE IS A
TRUE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION, THE FMLN MAINTAINS ITS POSITION OF TRYING TO
SUBDUE THE PEOPLE WITH A TOTALITARIAN PLAN THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS.  "HISTORY
HAS LEFT THEM BEHIND AND THEY (THE TERRORISTS) HAVE NOT NOTICED IT," HE
ADDED.

   CALDERON SOL EMPHASIZED THAT FMLN LEADERS SHOULD RECONSIDER THE POSITION
THEY HAVE MAINTAINED AND SHOULD RESPECT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE WITHOUT
IT, NO NATION CAN ACHIEVE HARMONY AND DEVELOPMENT.

   THE SEDITIOUS "SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE ALONE AND THAT NO ONE
SUPPORTS THEIR ANARCHIC PLAN," THE ARENA PRESIDENT ADDED.  HE RECALLED THAT
DURING THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPORTED THE
ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUPPORT.

   CALDERON SOL STRESSED THAT THE FMLN MUST PROVIDE REAL PROOF THAT IT WANTS
TO REACH PEACE THROUGH NEGOTIATED MEANS, BECAUSE PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS GOOD
INTENTIONS AND WANTS TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THROUGH TALKS.

   THE SUBVERSIVES MUST SUSPEND THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT BE AT THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE WHILE THE FMLN AT THE SAME TIME IS PREPARING AN OFFENSIVE.
