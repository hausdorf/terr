   BOGOTA, 19 JAN 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [STATEMENT]
[TEXT] IN RESPONSE TO REPORTS DISSEMINATED BY THE MEDIA WITH REGARD TO
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM, THE COLOMBIAN
PRESIDENT ADVISES THE COLOMBIA PEOPLE OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1. THE GOVERNMENT'S FIRM, COHERENT, AND EFFICIENT POLICY TO ENFORCE
THE LAW HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WITH REGARD TO THE CONTROL OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THAT POLICY HAS CREATED A NEW
SITUATION, WHICH HAS RAISED A NUMBER OF EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE.

   2. THE ACTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ARMED FORCES, THE NATIONAL POLICE,
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED OUT TO COMPLETE THE DISMANTLING OF
GROUPS OF MURDERERS AND NARCO-TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.

   3. THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE ALL THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL THEIR DUTY OF ENFORCING THE LAW AND BRINGING
CRIMINALS BEFORE JUSTICE ACCORDING TO CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL
PROCEDURES AND THE OPTIONS OFFERED BY THE LAW.

   4. THE STATEMENTS BY FOUR FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENTS, BY THE
CARDINAL AND ARCHBISHOP OF COLOMBIA, AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE
PATRIOTIC UNION ARE PATRIOTIC ACTIONS INTENDED TO SPARE COLOMBIANS
MORE SUFFERING AND PAIN.  THE GOVERNMENT HIGHLY APPRECIATES THE
MEANING OF THOSE STATEMENTS.  THOSE STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE THREE
COLOMBIAN PARTIES AND THE CHURCH. [SENTENCE AS HEARD]

   5. THE COUNTRY HAS ACTED WITH CALM, CAUTION, REALISM, AND
RESPONSIBILITY.  THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE DID NOT LET THEMSELVES BE
CARRIED AWAY BY RECKLESS EXPECTATIONS.  THE COUNTRY MUST MAINTAIN THAT
ATTITUDE.

   6. AUTHORIZED MEDIA SPOKESMEN HAVE MENTIONED THE MANY QUESTIONS
THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ASK THEMSELVES CONCERNING THAT SITUATION,
WHICH ONLY THE FUTURE CAN CONVINCINGLY CLARIFY.

   7. THE COUNTRY LONGS FOR THE COMPLETE END TO CRIMES, MURDERS, AND
ATTACKS AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS, NEWSMEN, POLITICAL LEADERS, AND MEN,
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN.  THE COUNTRY LONGS FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED AND THE DEFINITIVE SUSPENSION OF DRUG
TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES.

   THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY AND THE ENORMOUS SACRIFICES COURAGEOUSLY
MADE BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE SEEK THOSE OBJECTIVES, AMONG OTHER
THINGS.

   8. NOW THAT THE STATE'S VICTORY AND THE NEED TO ABIDE BY THE
COUNTRY'S LAW ARE ADMITTED, WE MUST WALK ALONG THE BEST PATH TO ENSURE
THE FINAL SUCCESS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY, WHICH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED
BY THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
