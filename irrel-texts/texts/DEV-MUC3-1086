DEV-MUC3-1086 (UNISYS)

   CLANDESTINE, 2 FEB 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HEREBY NOTIFIES THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF THE FOLLOWING:

   1. WE SEE AS POSITIVE THAT MR CRISTIANI HAS ACCEPTED UN SECRETARY
GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE NEGOTIATION
PROCESS IN EL SALVADOR.  WE FEEL THAT THE MEDIATION OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
SERIOUSLY COMMIT BOTH PARTIES TO NEGOTIATION AND OFFER TRUE
POSSIBILITIES SO THAT THE PROCESS WILL LEAD TOWARD A SOLUTION THAT
WILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY.

   2. IN VIEW OF THESE POSSIBILITIES, IT IS HIGHLY NEGATIVE THAT THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE INCREASED IN THE FORTHCOMING
FISCAL PERIODS.  IF THIS DECISION IS RATIFIED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS, IT
WOULD MEAN A DEFINITE DETERMINATION TO PROLONG THE WAR AND THE FAILURE
OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT COULD LEAD TO THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THE ASSISTANCE STRENGTHENS THE EXTREMISTS.  THE
POLITICAL PRESSURE MAKES IT NECESSARY TO TAKE POLITICAL ACTIONS AND
STRENGTHENS THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.

   3. THE ARMY CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT PERMANENT MILITARY OFFENSIVES
AND REPRESSION.  THERE CONTINUE TO BE A STATE OF SIEGE, MURDERS,
ARRESTS, AND PERSECUTION AGAINST PEOPLE'S AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS;
THE PRESS CONTINUES TO BE CONTROLLED; AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS
CONTINUE TO BE VIOLATED AS THE EVACUATION OF FMLN WAR CRIPPLES IS NOT
ALLOWED.

   COL PONCE OPENLY PROCLAIMS HIS "VICTORY AND HAMMER" OFFENSIVE
AGAINST FMLN POSITIONS.  THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE, AS THE GOVERNMENT
WANTS THE FMLN TO UNILATERALLY SUSPEND OPERATIONS.  AS LONG AS THERE
ARE REPRESSION AND LARGE MILITARY OFFENSIVES, AND A CEASE-FIRE IS NOT
AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES, WE ARE OBLIGED TO REMAIN AT WAR AND MAKE
OFFENSIVE USE OF OUR MILITARY FORCE IN ANY PART OF THE NATION TO
ACHIEVE SERIOUS NEGOTIATION THAT WILL FIND A JUST SOLUTION TO THE WAR.

   [SIGNED] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND

   [DATED] 2 FEBURARY 1990, EL SALVADOR
