   SAN SALVADOR, 20 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE ARMED FORCES
MAINTAIN CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL.  AFTER 6 [NUMBER AS HEARD] DAYS OF INTENSE
BATTLES BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE SHOWN
THEIR PROFESSIONALISM BY ACHIEVING TOTAL CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL.  THE
LOCATIONS WHERE THERE WERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS -- THE SLOPES OF SAN JACINTO
HILL IN THE SOUTH AND SOYAPANGO, CIUDAD DELGADO, MEJICANOS, AND ZACAMIL --
HAVE BEEN RETAKEN BY THE ARMY DURING THE WEEKEND.  EVEN THOUGH THE ARMY HAD
DISLODGED THE MARXIST - LENINISTS FROM MEJICANOS, CIVILIAN ACCESS TO THAT
AREA HAS NOT BEEN PERMITTED BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS MINED THE ENTRANCES TO
SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND SEVERAL HOUSES OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT COOPERATE
WITH THEM.  IN CIUDAD DELGADO, ARMED FORCES SOLDIERS FOUGHT SMALL GROUPS OF
GUERRILLAS WHO HAD HIDDEN IN HOUSES AND WHO PUT UP SOME RESISTANCE, WHICH
WAS QUICKLY CONTROLLED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  THE ARMED FORCES MAINTAIN
ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER AMATEPEC AND CIUDAD CREDISA NEIGHBORHOODS.

   ONWARD BRAVE SOLDIERS.  CONTINUE FIGHTING TO KEEP OUR FATHERLAND
FREE WITH GUARANTEES FOR ALL HONEST SALVADORANS.
