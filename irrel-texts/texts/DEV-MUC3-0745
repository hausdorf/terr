   MANAGUA, 14 NOV (DPA) -- [TEXT] A LEADER OF THE INSURRECTIONAL
MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR TODAY SAID IN MANAGUA THAT THE MILITARY
CAMPAIGN THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS HAVE LAUNCHED AGAINST ARMY
TROOPS ON VARIOUS FRONTS AIMS TO CREATE THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR
A "GENUINE DIALOGUE" WITH GUARANTEES FOR THE PEOPLE.

   COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, MEMBER OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT'S (FMLN) POLITICAL COMMISSION, SAID THAT THE REBELS
HAVE ORDERS TO "ADVANCE" AND CONTROL THE "FREED ZONES" AS PART OF ITS
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ARMY OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S "FASCIST GOVERNMENT,
WHICH IS MAINTAINING A SOCIALLY UNJUST REGIME.

   LOPEZ, WHO IS ALSO KNOWN AS "COMMANDER VENANCIO SALVATIERRA," SAID
THAT THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HAS USED MORE THAN 15 AIRCRAFTS TO BOMB
CIVILIANS IN SOYAPANGO, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR, AND
NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN MIGUEL, CAUSING SERIOUS STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND
KILLING CIVILIANS.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA LEADER POINTED OUT THAT THE FMLN MILITARY
CAMPAIGN, WHICH BEGAN WITH NATIONWIDE ATTACKS ON 11 NOVEMBER, HAS
ENJOYED "POPULAR SUPPORT" WHICH MAKES IT "AN INSURRECTION WHOSE SCOPE
IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE."

   HE ADDED THAT THIS REACTION MEANS THAT THE FMLN "CANNOT ALLOW BLOWS
AGAINST THE PEOPLE TO TAKE PLACE WITH IMPUNITY."

   "WE ARE SEEKING A CHANGE IN THE CORRELATION OF FORCES THAT WOULD
BRING ABOUT APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS FOR A GENUINE DIALOGUE," MARIO
LOPEZ POINTED OUT.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI
MUST "QUIT HOPING FOR A MILITARY VICTORY OVER THE FMLN."

   AS FOR EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, LOPEZ SAID THAT EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE BY
VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT THE GENOCIDAL ACTIONS OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY.  HE SAID THAT THE FMLN IS MAKING SUCH EFFORTS AT THE UNITED
NATIONS AND OAS WHERE NICARAGUA HAS PROPOSED A RESUMPTION OF
NEGOTIATIONS.

   HE ADDED THAT FOR THE TIME BEING, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ARE
ORGANIZING "POPULAR GOVERNMENTS" IN THE "FREED ZONES," HOWEVER, HE
SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE ETABLISHMENT OF A PROVISIONAL FMLN GOVERNMENT.

   LOPEZ SAID THAT AN INTERVENTION BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY IN THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT, BY SUPPORTING THE CRISTIANI ARMY, "WOULD BE
DANGEROUS FOR CENTRAL AMERICA BECAUSE THE CONFLICT COULD BE SPREADED."
HE RECALLED THAT GUATEMALA IS FACING A GUERRILLA STRUGGLE WHICH IS
OLDER THAN THE ONE IN EL SALVADOR.

   LOPEZ DENIED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS EXIST BECAUSE OF THE
USSR, CUBA, AND NICARAGUA AND ADDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA
STRUGGLE IS OLDER THAN THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT ITSELF (1979).  HE
ADDED THAT THE FMLN HAS DEVELOPED ITS OWN STRATEGIES AND EVEN ITS OWN
WEAPONS, HOWEVER, HE ADMITTED THAT IT RECEIVES WEAPONS FROM ABROAD.
HE PROVIDED NO FUTHER DETAILS ON THE FMLN'S "OWN" WEAPONS.
