   TEGUCIGALPA, 7 AUG 89 (RADIO AMERICA) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [TEXT]
[REPORTER] WHAT IS THE PREVAILING ATMOSPHERE NOW?

   [ORTEGA] I THINK THAT ALL OF THE PRESIDENTS ARE HOPING THAT AN
AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. WE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY WORKING ON THAT
AGREEMENT SO THAT A FINAL AGREEMENT CAN BE ISSUED. WE HAVE PREPARED
DOCUMENTS ON WHICH, I WOULD SAY, THERE IS A CERTAIN CONSENSUS--SUCH AS
ON THE DOCUMENT ON THE [WORD INDISTINCT] OF THE CONTRAS, THE DOCUMENT
ON THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE SUIT NICARAGUA HAS
FILED BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, THE SALVADORAN ISSUE,
AND OTHER POINTS.

   I THINK THERE IS A POLITICAL RESOLVE ON THE PART OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING POSITIVE EMERGES FROM THIS SUMMIT. I
AM SURE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS HOPING THAT NOTHING WILL RESULT FROM
THIS SUMMIT. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY
EXERTING STRONG PRESSURES SO THAT NOTHING WILL COME FROM THIS SUMMIT.

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT: WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES FOR NICARAGUA'S
WITHDRAWAL OF ITS SUIT AGAINST HONDURAS?  

   [ORTEGA] THIS HAS TO BE LINKED TO COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN FOR
THE CONTRA WITHDRAWAL.  

   [REPORTER] IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONTRAS MUST FIRST LEAVE?

   [ORTEGA] OF COURSE.  THAT IS OUR INSURANCE.  

   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, HAS HONDURAS AGREED TO THIS?  

   [ORTEGA] WE ARE EXCHANGING VIEWPOINTS ON THIS.

   [REPORTER] THE SUIT REPRESENTS AN INSURANCE FOR YOU,
COMMANDER?  WHICH GROUPS HAS THE UNITED STATES BEEN PRESSURING?  

   [ORTEGA] THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GROUPS. THERE HAVE BEEN DIRECT AND
INDIRECT CONTACTS. THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTACTED THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN DELEGATIONS IN HOPES THAT NO AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. THE
AMERICANS CONTINUE TO FAVOR THE PRESENCE OF THE CONTRAS. THE FACT THAT
PRESIDENT BUSH MET WITH CONTRA LEADERS ON THE EVE OF THIS CENTRAL
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SUMMIT IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THIS MEETING.

   [REPORTER] WHEN YOU MENTION THESE PRESSURES, MR PRESIDENT, TO WHICH
COUNTRIES ARE YOU REFERRING?

   [ORTEGA] ALL OF THEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICARAGUA. I HAVE NO DOUBTS
THAT RIGHT NOW THE UNITED STATES IS EXERTING PRESSURE, BECAUSE IT WANTS TO
KILL THIS SUMMIT JUST WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. IF NO
AGREEMENT IS REACHED AT THIS SUMMIT, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] BECAUSE WE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE
SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY AND SUFFICIENT SELF-DETERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE TO
DECIDE OUR OWN ACTIONS.

   [REPORTER] AT THIS STAGE, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENTS SUMMIT?
IS THIS SUMMIT A FAILURE OR A SUCCESS?

   [ORTEGA] I THINK IT HAS TO BE A SUCCESS, EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES HAS
NOT GIVEN UP TRYING TO MAKE IT FAIL. THIS IS THE TIME, AND I AM SURE THAT IT
IS TRYING [WORDS INDISTINCT].
