   SAN SALVADOR, 26 SEP 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF NOT WANTING TO NEGOTIATE THE END
OF THE WAR AND INCREASING THE "REPRESSION" AGAINST WORKERS.

   IN A LETTER DISCLOSED ON MONDAY, 25 SEPTEMBER, AND SENT TO THE
UNITED NATIONS, THE OAS, AND THE FOREIGN MINISTRIES OF EUROPE AND THE
AMERICAS, THE REBELS SAY THAT SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI
AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES "ARE MAINTAINING THEIR INFLEXIBILITY,
USING THE CONSTITUTION AS AN EXCUSE."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IS WARNING
THAT THERE ARE TWO STANCES IN THE FACE OF THE DIALOGUE: ONE IS OF
"FLEXIBILITY AND GOODWILL," AND THE OTHER, OF "INFLEXIBILITY AND
PROVOCATION THAT USES THE DIALOGUE TO ESCALATE THE WAR AND
REPRESSION."

   IN ITS LETTER, THE FMLN GAVE A RUNDOWN OF ITS BIDS TO "PROMOTE A
DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION" WITH THE GOVERNMENT, MENTIONING ITS UNILATERAL
TRUCE AND DECISION TO STOP SABOTAGING THE ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE
NETWORKS AND USING MINES.

   IN ADDITION, THE GROUP NOTED IT SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL "THAT IS VERY
FLEXIBLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE," AND THAT CONSIDERS THE END OF
HOSTILITIES AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE REBELS MAY BECOME A POLITICAL
PARTY.

   HOWEVER, THE REBELS STATED THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED HUMAN
RIGHTS "VIOLATIONS," AND IS KEEPING A CIRCLE AROUND THE UNIVERSITY
CAMPUS AND TRADE UNIONS, YET IT WANTS DILATORY TALKS WITHOUT
COMMITTMENTS.

   THE FMLN SAID THE APPROVAL BY THE U.S. SENATE OF MILITARY AID TO EL
SALVADOR, UPPING IT FROM $85 TO $90 MILLION, "ENCOURAGES THE MOST HARD
LINE SECTOR OF THE CURRENT SALVADORAN REGIME."

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE MILITARY AID "CONSTITUTES A HARD
BLOW AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL
SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT," THAT IN 9 YEARS HAS CLAIMED OVER 70,000
LIVES.

   GOVERNMENT AND FMLN DELEGATIONS MET FROM 13 TO 15 SEPTEMBER IN
MEXICO AND PLEDGED TO SEEK A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THAT COUNTRY'S
STRIFE.

   THE TWO DELEGATIONS AGREED TO CONTINUE THE TALKS ON 16 AND 17
OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE TO ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITY OF A CEASE-FIRE AND
ESTABLISH THE STEPS TO END THE WAR.

   DIVERSE LOCAL SECTORS, WHICH ARE DEMANDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO
THE WAR, HAVE RECEIVED THE AGREEMENTS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF OPTIMISM.

   HOWEVER, SOME LEADERS OF RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE
(ARENA) AND SOME MILITARY CHIEFS HAVE QUESTIONED THE FMLN'S OFFERS.
