   CLANDESTINE, 22 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY]  [TEXT] MR.
WALKER, WHEN WILL YOU TELL YOUR PRESIDENT BUSH TO STOP BEING SO RUDE.  HE
HAS BEEN TALKING TOO MUCH.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] HEAR YOUR OWN PEOPLE SPEAK
DEMANDING PEACE.  THIS IS NOT RIGHT.  IS THIS IS THE DEMOCRACY YOU PEOPLE
WANT TO EXIST HERE?  BUT YOU PEOPLE ARE WRONG, MR.  WALKER.  IT WILL BE
IMPOSSIBLE HERE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE A VOLCANO IN ERUPTION.  WHOEVER PUTS
HIS HAND IN THE FIRE WILL GET BURNED, MR.  WALKER.  STOP STICKING YOUR NOSE
INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS.  YOU SHOULD RATHER SEND AWAY, ONCE AND FOR
ALL, THOSE COUNTRYMEN OF YOURS WHO HAVE BEEN SENT HERE AS ADVISERS.  THEY
ARE ADVISERS, ALL RIGHT, BUT OF THE DEATH SQUADS.  I HAVE JUST ONE PIECE OF
ADVICE FOR YOU.  UNDERSTAND ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT WHOEVER PUTS HIS HAND IN
THE FIRE WILL GET BURNED.  THE LAVA OF THIS ERUPTING VOLCANO IS BOILING,
MR.  WALKER.  UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT TAKE ONE STEP BACK.  ALL
FOR PEACE.

   WE HAVE BEEN READING THE SUMMARY OF OUR NEWS MONITORING.  U.S.  PENTAGON
MILITARY OFFICIALS AND MANY NONMILITARY ANALYSTS ARE SURPRISED OVER WHAT
THEY CALL THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S OFFENSIVE
CAPABILITIES.  A REPORT STATES THAT PENTAGON OFFICIALS ARE VERY SURPRISED
OVER THE FMLN MANEUVERABILITY AND OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES.  THE FMLN ACTIONS
OF THE PAST DAYS HAS SPOILED ALL THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SALVADORAN
MILITARY MEN SENT TO U.S.  OFFICIALS CONTAINING INFORMATION ON THE FMLN
MANPOWER-WEAPONS RATIO AND OUR MILITARY ABILITY TO OPERATE.

   THE FMLN HAS NEVER LOST ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES.  SOME ANALYSTS VIEW
THE SALVADORAN WAR AS A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  THAT IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE
THE SALVADORAN WAR IS NOT A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  IT CANNOT BE VIEWED AS
IF IT WERE A REGULAR WAR SUCH AS THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  EL SALVADOR IS LIVING
THROUGH CONFLICT THAT IS MAINLY SOCIAL IN NATURE, A CONFLICT THAT IS ROOTED
IN SOCIAL INJUSTICE.  THE FMLN DID NOT EMERGE FROM A MILITARY SCHOOL WITH A
REARGUARD IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, BUT IT IS MADE UP OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.
FMLN COMBATANTS HAVE LEARNED TO FIGHT IN ACTUAL CLASHES.  THEY HAVE GAINED
GROUND INCH BY INCH; IT HAS ORGANIZED THE PEOPLE.  THE FMLN DOES NOT
FORCEFULLY RECRUIT PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, IT IS NOT PERIODICALLY RENEWING ITS
RANKS AS THE ARMY DOES THROUGH FORCEFUL RECRUITMENT.  TO THE FMLN, THE MAIN
GOAL IS TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE, TO GET AS CLOSE AS IT CAN TO THE PEOPLE.

   BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, SOCIAL INJUSTICE, AND LACK OF DEMOCRATIC
OPPORTUNITIES IN [EL] SALVADOR, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS HAVE NO OTHER
OPTION THAN TO TAKE UP ARMS AND FIGHT TO ACHIEVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS IN
THE FACE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BRUTAL REPRESSION, ECONOMIC INJUSTICE, AND
UNEMPLOYMENT.  TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS DECIDED TO
TAKE UP ARMS AND LEARN TO WAGE WAR BY FIGHTING DAIILY.  THAT IS THE HISTORY
OF THE FMLN.

   THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT TWO ARMIES ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.
THE LOGISTICS APPARATUS OF THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT' [ARMED] FORCES IS NOT
COMPARABLE TO OUR FORCES.  THEY BRING TO OUR COUNTRY TONS OF BOMBS, RIFLES,
BOOTS, AND MATERIAL THROUGH PORTS AND MILITARY AIRPORTS.  ALTHOUGH THE
GOVERNMENTS OF NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND THE USSR COULD HELP THE FMLN, AS MANY
ARE SAYING, THE FIREPOWER OF OUR FORCES COULD NEVER BE COMPARED TO THE
ARMY'S.

   NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN HAS OPENED IN ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE
[UNITED] STATES, THE NECESSARY WAYS FOR US TO OBTAIN OUR ARMS AND
AMMUNITION.  WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS.  HOW DOES THE FMLN LEARN TO FIGHT--
BY FIGHTING.  WE ARE NOW FIGHTING IN CITIES.  EVERY MILITARY ANALYST KNOWS
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIGHT IN URBAN AREAS.  THE FMLN FIGHTING IN SAN
SALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, AND USULUTAN HAS SHOWN THE
ORGANIZATION'S TREMENDOUS ABILITY TO WEAR OUT THE ENEMY, TAKE AND HOLD
POSITIONS, AND MANEUVER IN THE CITY JUST AS IT HAS DONE IN RURAL AREAS.  THE
FMLN ABILITY HAS SURPRISED THE MILITARY ANALYSTS AT THE PENTAGON.  OUR FRONT
HAS ALWAYS HAD THIS ABILITY.  BUT NOW WE HAVE CHANGED OUR STRATEGY AND
TACTICS TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY PLANS.  THE [ARMED] FORCES HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN
REGARDING THE ACTIONS BY PATROLS [WORDS INDISTINCT], SPECIAL OPERATIONS.
THE FMLN HAD TO CHANGE ITS STRATEGY TO STRIKE AT THE SMALL FORCES THAT TRIED
TO INFILTRATE OUR ZONE UNDER COVER.  ONLY THUS COULD WE ANNIHILATE AND
DEFEAT THESE FORCES AND THEIR STRATEGY.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE DID.  THIS IS
WHAT MUST BE OBSERVED, HOW THE FMLN HAS CHANGED ITS MILITARY STRATEGY TO
FACE THE ONE USED BY THE [ARMED] FORCES.  OF COURSE, WE HAVE ACCUMULATED
GREAT EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS, WHICH WE HAVE APPLIED THESE LAST DAYS IN
COMBAT IN [SAN] SALVADOR AND [SAN] MIGUEL.  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS ARE
BEING DESTROYED IN STREETS AND AVENUES; HELICOPTERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN;
SOLDIERS ARE BEING TAKEN PRISONER; AND ARMS ARE BEING SEIZED.

    MILITARY ANALYSTS ARE WONDERING HOW A GUERRILLA ARMY CAN OPERATE FOR SO
LONG IN AN URBAN AREA.  IN ADDITION, LOGISTICS MUST BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION.  THE [ARMED] FORCES ARE CONSTANTLY GETTING AMMUNITION THROUGH
THE ILOPANGO [AIR] BASE.  THE FMLN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION
BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT.  THOUSANDS OF CAPITAL RESIDENTS COOPERATED
BY KEEPING SILENT WHEN THEY SAW THE GUERRILLA COLUMNS PASS BY.  THEY DID NOT
WARN THE [ARMED] FORCES.  WHY?  BECAUSE THE PEOPLE SEE IN THESE GUERRILLA
COLUMNS THEIR OWN ARMY.
