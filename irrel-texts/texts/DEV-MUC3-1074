   SAN SALVADOR, 25 JAN 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON
THE POLICE IN WASHINGTON ARRESTED THE LEADERS OF A GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS
WHO HAD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL TO DEMAND THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY
AID TO EL SALVADOR.  A FEW HOURS LATER, REPRESENTATIVES OF SEVERAL CHURCHES
ASSERTED THAT A PERSECUTION HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN OUR COUNTRY AGAINST
"RELIGIOUS PEOPLE" AND THAT THE AID SHOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THAT REASON.
THE FOREGONE CONCLUSION WAS THAT, BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE AID, OUR
GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE TERRORISTS.

   THIS CAMPAIGN DATES BACK A LONG TIME.  IT BEGAN WITH THE ARRIVAL IN
EL SALVADOR OF SEVERAL JESUIT PRIESTS FROM LOVAINA UNIVERSITY IN THE
EARLY 1960'S AND CONTINUED WITH THE FOUNDING OF UCA [JOSE SIMEON CANAS
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY], THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF
CERTAIN PRIESTS IN THE SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS, THE AGITATION LAUNCHED BY
THE ALAS [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] PRIESTS, THE TRAGIC EPISODE
INVOLVING MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, AND THE USE OF THAT EPISODE BY
THE LEFT.  EL SALVADOR WAS, AND TO SOME EXTENT CONTINUES TO BE, THE
SCENARIO IN WHICH THE "THEOLOGY OF LIBERATION" REACHED ITS ULTIMATE
CONSEQUENCES BY PLACING THE INQUISITORIAL FANATICISM OF CERTAIN
PRIESTS AND PASTORS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE MOST RADICAL CURRENTS OF
SOCIALISM.

   THE VIRULENCE OF THE ONSLAUGHT WENT THAT FAR PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE
PASSIVE ATTITUDE -- OR, RATHER, THE CONNIVING PERMISSIVENESS -- OF THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC REGIME, WHICH TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
STRIDENT CAMPAIGN TO FURTHER ITS OWN POLITICAL ENDS.  DUARTE NEVER
TRULY DISTANCED HIMSELF FAR FROM THE GUERRILLAS BECAUSE OF HIS
ILL-DISGUISED IDEOLOGICAL LEANINGS, WHICH LED HIM TO COINCIDE IN GREAT
PART WITH THE SUBVERSIVES' TENETS AND ABOVE ALL WITH THE FANCIFUL IDEA
THAT THE PEOPLE APPROVED OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMUNIST STATE IN
EL SALVADOR.

   IT IS CERTAINLY DIFFICULT TO COUNTER ORGANIZED SLANDER, TAKING INTO
CONSIDERATION HOW FAR CERTAIN NOTIONS HAVE GONE AND HOW MUCH SUPPORT
THEY RECEIVE FROM THE NEWS MEDIA IN A LARGE PART OF THE WORLD.  THE
POSSIBILITIES OF SUCCESSFULLY COUNTERING THIS PROPAGANDA OFFENSIVE MAY
NOT BE THE BEST, BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE TO REMAIN SILENT AND DO
NOTHING.  WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE ORGANIZATION OF A TRUE EFFORT TO
REJECT THE PERMANENT DEFAMATION BEING WITHSTOOD BY THE COUNTRY.

   THERE IS NO ANSWER TO THE ACCUSATIONS AND INSULTS ISSUED BY CERTAIN
SECTORS, EITHER.  TO ALLOW A PERSON WHO ACTS AS LEADER OF THE
TERRORISTS' POLITICAL FRONT TO COME TO THE COUNTRY AND SCOLD PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI WITHOUT HAVING THE AUTHORITIES ARREST HIM FOR HIS
PARTICIPATION IN CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST THE REPUBLIC IS TO FALL
INTO DANGEROUS EXTREMES OF TOLERANCE.  WAS NOT JENNIFER CASOLO ALLOWED
TO OPENLY REPRESENT THE SUBVERSIVES FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT
INVESTIGATING HER MORE CLOSELY?  IS IT PERHAPS THAT THE LAWS ALLOW A
FOREIGNER TO MEDDLE IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS?

   HOW CAN JUDGES BE BANNED FROM CERTAIN INSTALLATIONS, SUCH AS THE THE
BOMBED FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION]
HEADQUARTERS, UNIVERSITIES, AND SIMILAR PLACES, WHEN THERE ARE SUFFICIENT
GROUNDS TO SUSPECT THAT TERRORISTS ARE HIDDEN IN SUCH PLACES?
