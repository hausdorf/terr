   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [REPORT] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] CRISTIANI
EMPHASIZED THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE CAPABLE OF COUNTERING ANY
AGGRESSION ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  HE ALSO TERMED AS A COMPLETE
FAILURE THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE, WHICH WAS SPURNED BY THE CITIZENRY,
ADDING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE
FMLN'S TERRORIST ACTIONS.

   [CRISTIANI] "LET US SAY THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT ARE PREPARED TO MILITARILY COUNTER THE AGGRESSION FOR AS
LONG AS THE FMLN WANTS TO.  THE FMLN DECIDED TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE
BECAUSE IT THOUGHT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SUPPORTED IT [WORDS
INDISTINCT] THE PEOPLE HAVE SPURNED IT ONCE AGAIN.  THE ONLY THING THE
FMLN HAS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE IS TO EARN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S SCORN."

   "WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT A CEASE-FIRE AND NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE BUT
WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENDING OF HOSTILITIES SHOULD BE THE FIRST GESTURE
BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TALK TO THE FMLN.  IF THIS DOES
NOT OCCUR, I DO NOT THINK THAT ONE SINGLE SALVADORAN WILL TRUST THE
FMLN IN THE LEAST [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE, MEANING THE ARMED FORCES
AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, DO NOT WANT TO [WORDS
INDISTINCT]."

   THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE CURFEW WILL
BE MODIFIED, PARTICULARLY IN PLACES WHERE ORDER HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
RESTORED.  HE ALSO EXPLAINED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER SOUGHT A
MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT BECAUSE THAT IS CLARIFIED IN
THE CONSTITUTION.

    CRISTIANI "WE HAVE NEVER SOUGHT A MILITARY SOLUTION.  THE FMLN IS
THE ONE WHICH HAS OPTED FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION.  WE HAVE NOT [WORDS
INDISTINCT] GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WEAPONS AND WE HAVE NOT
SOUGHT THE ARMED FORCES TO DO IT.  THE FMLN IS THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO
SEIZE POWER WITH ITS WEAPONS.  THE ARMED FORCES HAS ONLY FULFILLED ITS
DUTY, WHICH IS TO COUNTER AN ARMED ACTION."

   "FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AGGRESSION IS [WORDS INDISTINCT]
NICARAGUA AND CUBA, BECAUSE NICARAGUA AND CUBA [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE
FMLN WOULD HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] PEACE IN EL
SALVADOR."

   THE PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE WITH THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS BUT IT MUST BE FULLY CONVINCED THAT THE REBEL GROUPS
ARE WILLING TO PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
IN A PEACEFUL AND VOLUNTARY WAY.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
ROLE IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, WAS LIMITED TO NOTIFYING HIS COUNTERPART,
CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ABOUT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION AND REASSERTING
THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION GIVEN THE FMLN DELEGATION'S ABSENCE -- WHICH
CONFIRMED THEIR LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE.
