STRUCTURE REMAINS INTACT AND THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL

OFFENSIVE.  COL ZEPEDA SAID THAT THE COMMUNIST'S INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK
WAS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND NOT AGAINST THE
MILITARY.  ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY CHIEF, THE TERRORISTS WERE TRYING

IMPORTANT TO NEUTRALIZE THE FMLN'S COMMUNIST ATTACK.  THE DEPUTY

ZEPEDA MENTIONED THE ALTOS DE LA CUEVA CASE IN SAN MIGUEL, WHERE
APPROXIMATELY A MILLION ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WERE FOUND.  ZEPEDA
CALLED ON THE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR TRUST IN THE ARMED FORCES,
ADDING THAT THE ARMED FORCES' MORALE IS HIGH, VERY HIGH.
