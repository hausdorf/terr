   MOSCOW (USSR), 5 OCT 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [COMMENTARY]
[MARINA PETROVSKAYA] [TEXT] THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS
APPROVED BY A MAJORITY VOTE AN ANTI-NICARAGUAN RESOLUTION WHICH GRANTS
$4 MILLION WORTH OF SO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS.
ANALYST MARINA PETROVSKAYA DISCUSSES THE SUBJECT.

   THIS RESOLUTION IN ESSENCE ALLOWS THE CONTINUATION OF THE DIRTY WAR
AGAINST NICARAGUA.  THE SOMOSA FORCES HAVE LATELY INCREASED THEIR
TERRORIST ACTIONS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF NICARAGUA BY KILLING CIVILIANS
AND SANDINIST SOLDIERS.  AS WITNESSED BY THE [WORD INDISTINCT], THIS
HAS NOT HAPPENED BY CHANCE.  MANY CONTRAS TURNED THEMSELVES INTO THE
NICARAGUAN AUTHORITIES WHEN AND AMNESTY WAS DECLARED.  THEY ADMITTED
THAT THEY RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THEIR LEADERS IN HONDURAS TO CROSS THE
BORDER AND, BY MEANS OF TERROR AND THREAT, FORCED CIVILIANS TO VOTE
FOR THE OPPOSITION CANDIDATES.

   SUPRISINGLY, THE SOMOSA FORCES HAVE NOT AIMED AT MORE AMBITIOUS
GOALS.  INSTEAD OF BEING CONDEMNED BY WASHINGTON THEY ARE RECEIVING
COMPLEMENTARY AID FROM IT.  CURIOUSLY, THIS NEW [WORD INDISTINCT] FOR
THE CONTRAS COINCIDES WITH THE GRANTING OF $9 MILLION TO FINANCE THE
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN OF THE NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION, JUST WHEN MRS VIOLETA
DE CHAMORRO HAS RECEIVED $3 MILLION FOR HERSELF.

   SUCH US GOVERNMENT AID FOR THE NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST SECTORS ALARMS
THE NICARAGUAN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES.  ELECTIONS WILL BE
HELD IN NICARAGUA IN A FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL
DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS WHICH IS BEING CONDUCTED IN KEEPING WITH THE
COMMITMENTS ASSUMED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS FROM GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.

   THIS DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS CANNOT BE NORMAL SINCE CONFRONTATIONS
BETWEEN CONTRAS AND [WORD INDISTINCT] ARE INCREASING, AND THESE ARE
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UNITED STATES.  AS IS KNOWN, THE SANDINIST
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SUSPEND THE CESSATION OF MILITARY
OPERATION AGAINST THE SOMOSA FORCES, WHICH HAD BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE
MAY 1988.

   MEANWHILE, WASHINGTON HAS ACCUSED THE SANDINISTS OF VIOLATING
DEMOCRACY AND OF HINDERING A [WORD INDISTINCT] POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   [WORDS INDISTINCT] SUCH AN EVALUATION OF THE SANDINIST ACTION IS
UNJUST IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION, INCLUDING
NICARAGUA, IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE
CONFLICT MAKE AN EFFORT, NOT JUST ONE.

   LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR THESE DAYS.  IT LOOKED LIKE
THE CONDITIONS FOR A CEASE-FIRE HAD IMPROVED AND THIS IS WHY WE
APPLAUDED THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT].
BUT THE PROGRESS MADE WAS REJECTED BY THE RIGHTIST GROUPS WHICH
REFUSED TO HOLD CONSTRUCTIVE NEGOTIATIONS.  THIS IS WHY THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] REFUSES TO HOLD THE THIRD
ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CHANGE THEIR OLD
METHODS OF SOLVING INTERNAL PROBLEMS WITHOUT GUARANTEEING THE SECURITY
OF THE LEFTIST FORCES.

   IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE IN NICARAGUA AND EL
SALVADOR ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THE PEACE EFFORTS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES
ARE BEING OBSTRUCTED BY MILITARY FORCES FINANCED BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT, WHICH CONTINUES TO KEEP A HEATED ENVIRONMENT IN THOSE
COUNTRIES AND TO LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS FROM A POSITION OF FORCE.
